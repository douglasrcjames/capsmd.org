        <h1>Montgomery County is Losing More Taxpayer Income Than Most of the Rest of the Region</h1>
        <p>From 2006 through 2016, taxpayers earning a combined $17.5 billion (in inflation-adjusted 2016 dollars) moved into Montgomery County.  
            During the same period, taxpayers earning a combined $21.6 billion moved out.  
            That net loss of $4 billion of taxpayer income is the largest in the region except for Fairfax County, which lost $5.9 billion.  
            Hereâ€™s how Montgomery County compares to the rest of the region.

        <h3>Our Take</h3>
        <p>Montgomery County is not alone in losing taxpayer income from net migration.  
            But the county needs to do better in creating high-paying jobs and retaining those employees to turn this around.</p>
