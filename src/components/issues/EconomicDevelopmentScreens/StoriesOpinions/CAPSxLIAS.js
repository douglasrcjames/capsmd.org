                   <b>What is the name of your business?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Lia’s restaurant and we’ve been around since 2006.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>Tell us a little bit about Lia’s.</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Sure, Lia’s is my take on Italian. So we make fresh pastas and pizzas, salads, nice entrees.
                    Make a pretty good burger.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>How did you come up with the business idea?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Well, Lia’s was my third restaurant. My first two restaurants, Chef Geoff’s and Chef
                    Geoff’s Downtown, were both in Washington, D.C.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>Why did you start Lia’s in Montgomery County?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> I needed to spread the restaurants out a little bit. I couldn’t geographically put them all
                    together. But I had worked up at Clyde’s in Chevy Chase and enjoyed that location. Good
                    clientele and access to transportation. And the landlord, JBG, was eager to put someone who
                    had experience in this space.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>What are the positives and challenges of having a business in Montgomery
                    County?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> I think Montgomery County is a good place to do business, but I would not qualify it as a
                    great place to do business. And there are two primary issues that make it a challenging place.
                    One, is the way you have to purchase alcohol, liquor, beer and wine, is just strange and causes all
                    sorts of problems; and the second, the county keeps mandating hike after hike in minimum
                    wage, and is fighting to get rid of the tip credit. We can’t charge the prices to keep up with the
                    wages. And as a result, the profit margin, which is never very big to start with, gets chewed up
                    every single year. And I’m all for higher wages... I’d give every single one of my employees a
                    company car if there was something left, but if we keep raising wages as we are mandated to do,
                    the cost rises for everything else. It makes it hard to budget, <i>on budget.</i>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Eileen:</u></i> Another challenge is that some of our wines take a long time to get into the store, which
                    means we are not able to provide the items or products that are on our menu to guests.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Right. If you order a bottle of wine—and we’ve gone through this since 2006—if you’ve
                    got a bottle of wine on your list and you order it, in D.C. you just tell your sales rep and they’ll
                    say, “Hey no problem, I’ll throw it in the back of my car and I’ll bring it to you.”
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    That doesn’t happen in Montgomery County. Instead you have to wait ten days. So if you’re low
                    on something because you don’t want to keep too much inventory on hand, and you happen to
                    sell those wines that night, the next night...
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Eileen:</u></i> You’re not giving the guest the experience that we all ultimately want to give.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Kristen:</u></i> Carrying stock items which are more pedestrian, supermarket wines, is the only way
                    you can guarantee you’re going to have them in stock as you need them. But a lot of wines are
                    special order, so your rep has to register it through the county and then you have to wait for that,
                    and then maybe it shows up or maybe not. And if they bring you the wrong case of wine, you
                    can’t simply send it back, you have to go through a process of pick-up, which means you’re stuck
                    holding that product for weeks and weeks. Often times we end up selling it because it’s easier.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Eileen:</u> </i> Recently we had a keg with a broken seal [delivered] and it took three months to get it
                    picked up. It was a three month ordeal, calling the city so someone could come out and check to
                    make sure the seal was actually broken and we weren’t just sending something back, and then
                    the rep had to tag the item. I spent time calling the city, waiting for the rep, and waiting for the
                    keg to be picked up. So three months to send something back that was broken when it came to
                    us.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>Has the increase in minimum wage impacted the number of people you’re able to
                    employee at your restaurant?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Well, the margin in the restaurant business is tight. It’s not like there are a bunch of
                    people sitting around, right? And I’m running seven different restaurants right now in The
                    District, Maryland, and Virginia. And I always make payroll, but I’ve got restaurants that lose
                    money. So we staff tightly-- and sometimes we get burned on that because more guests show up
                    than we thought that particular day, and then service isn’t quite what you would like it to be.
                    And every time the wages go up, we have to look at how many people we can staff. There’s not a
                    pot of gold of profit where you can say, “Well, Geoff can take his millions and millions of dollars
                    and cut it to a million dollars.”
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    It’s just not there. You can’t get blood from a turnip. And so it turns into cuts and losses in the
                    restaurant, which turns into the inability to open other businesses that would employ people
                    and generate economic development. Or it crushes the little businesses who are local operators.
                    And it sends the message that chains can have a presence here and can make money because
                    they are larger national and international corporations.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Eileen:</u></i> And all our locations are neighborhood restaurants that feel like family. We know our
                    guests’ names, they know our names. They ask about us if we’re not here. They want to know
                    when we are going on vacation. So I think that’s the beauty of our establishment. And by
                    continuing to have these increases, it stifles our success. And some of the restaurants that aren’t
                    as successful, we could absolutely close, but then we hurt the community and that’s not what
                    Geoff stands for. Our vision is to keep a tight knit community and restaurant where we can come
                    together in good times and bad times.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> And like a said, I’m all for increases in wages if it’s economically viable. A lot of politicians
                    in The District and in Montgomery County tell me to just raise my prices. But then you’re
                    generating more tax for your customer, because you’re taxing higher priced items.
                    And at a 3% profit margin, you have the potential in certain months, even at Lia’s, to lose money
                    on the bottom line. So, I’m just not sure customers are ready for the prices to increase. I’m
                    convinced the growth of fast casual [dining], is due in part to higher labor rates--
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Eileen:</u></i> Because you can operate on a narrower margin. It’s a more viable business model.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> It’s cheaper to build, it’s cheaper to get out of, it employees less people-- you don’t need
                    general managers, and people making good salaries. At first it might be cool—you get to order
                    off an ipad—but that was a job, you know? All the parking lot attendants downstairs, are all
                    pretty much gone. It’s all automated now. So again, I’d pay everyone $100,000 if at the end of
                    the day I was making money and I could grow my business with the profits that I make, but it’s
                    just not the reality. And I’ve told politicians… to come look at my PNL. I’ll give any politician in
                    Montgomery County, Virginia, or DC my PNL and they can review the whole thing and
                    determine where I’m going to find an extra dollar an hour for all these employees.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>So what are the solutions?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Well I’m a free market capitalist, and we don’t have a free market capitalist society with
                    the sale of liquor in Montgomery County. But I’ve heard the story since 2006. I’ve gone to the
                    county council meetings, I’ve gone to the protests, I’ve heard the unions... the politicians don’t
                    want to give up the revenue. It’s just a revenue stream. That being said, they could up the
                    service. They could have multiple deliveries a week--
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Kristen:</u></i> and shorter lead time.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> You’d honestly generate more revenue because [businesses] would be stocked.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Eileen:</u></i> If you’re going to offer a service, then do the service. Do it in a timely manner, make sure
                    restaurants have guidelines so they understand turn around time, and make sure when you’re
                    going out with a delivery truck it’s full and that the route makes sense. We hear that alot-- trucks
                    don’t want to pick up all the empty kegs, even if they are next door at another restaurant, so then
                    you wait. Just give the service that you’re offering.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> It’s been awhile, but I’ve built in Rockville and I’ve built here. I’m not going to give any of
                    the jurisdictions around here particularly high marks for getting the inspections done. But you
                    know, make it a little friendlier process for the building and construction inspections. The
                    county takes away from essentially what we want to be doing, which is taking care of our teams
                    and taking care of our guests and you know, making good food and drink.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>Do you have any idea why deliveries and lead times are lengthy?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> No.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>What resources, government or otherwise, were most valuable when you were
                    opening the restaurants?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Well the whole process is not easy in Montgomery County. I mean when you get your
                    liquor license, you have to have someone on your corporate team who resides in Montgomery
                    County. Which is strange. It’d be one thing if you lived in Kansas and you were required to have
                    someone from Kansas, but in Montgomery County, if you hit a five iron you could end up in the
                    District of Columbia. I live two miles away, but I can’t be the person on my license. That’s
                    absurd. It seems like, let’s have a regulation for the sake of having a regulation.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>What would you say is the biggest challenge faced by entrepreneurs?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Biggest challenge is between my ears. When you have restaurants that are successful and
                    not successful, you start to second guess yourself on if you can pull it off. That being said, I
                    opened a business over the summer at Georgetown University, and I just signed a letter of intent
                    on a space in College Park, Maryland.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    And you know, some people will argue that profit is a negative thing, but people don’t realize
                    how much money you spend building these things. I put $1.5 million into Rockville, I lost
                    $500,000 on it. So I lost $2 million total. Just gone. Lia’s, I spent a lot of money and the
                    landlord spent a lot of money building this place, and it’s a big gamble. It’s not been an A+ win,
                    it's been a B- win for me economically.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>But in spite of the challenges, you continue to take the leap--</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> Well, I'm certifiably crazy, and it’s just how I'm programmed. I was just in Connecticut
                    yesterday, doing a thing with the Yukon Business School, and I spoke to the group and talked
                    about how you have to be wired a little differently to say, “Oh, you know how I'm going to make
                    money? I’m going to spend a bunch of money, and then hopefully over the next eights years, I'll
                    be able to make more than what I spent, and meanwhile I'm going to employee 50-60 people in
                    this particular location and pay money to a landlord.”
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>How do you let go of those things that could hold you back?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> I drink white wine. Relaxes the mind, instills confidence. No, I mean doing this energizes
                    me. I like the idea of creating something from nothing. And for whatever reason, when I was 17
                    years old, I got into this business as a busboy, and I have been in it ever since. It’s been 29 years
                    since my first job in the restaurant business, and 19 years doing it as an owner. At this point it’s
                    kind of old dog, new tricks. I have to keep myself occupied.
                </p>

                <p>
                   <b>Which of your accomplishments are you most proud of?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> It has been an amazing thing to see all the people who have worked for me. You know a
                    lot of people come through the restaurant business, it’s a unique world of people from all sorts of
                    backgrounds, and it employs a gazillion people. Restaurants are the second biggest employer in
                    the United States with the government being number one. So it’s been nice to meet those people,
                    watch them rise up within organizations. The Executive Chef at Lias started working for me 19
                    years ago and couldn’t speak English. Now he’s the executive chef and he speaks three different
                    languages. He comes to me with energy and excitement every single day, and cares about it. But
                    that’s not even a unique story in the restaurant business. So it’s been nice to have a platform for
                    people to move up and around and on from, to start their own businesses. And it’s always sad to
                    see them go, but all those friendships are still there.
                    I’ve been quoted before saying, “Owning a restaurant is a little like owning a pirate ship.” People
                    get on, people get off, there are mutinies, some are drinking, sometimes you find treasure-- and
                    it’s always exciting.
                </p>

                   <b>From where do you draw inspiration?</b>
                   <br/>

                    me inspiration. I still look back to my mentors, Rich Rosenthal at the Max Restaurant Group
                    and Tom Meyer with Clyde's Restaurant Group. And my wife’s an inspiration-- she’s just so
                    extraordinarily successful, I’m just hoping to keep up on any level.

                   <b>What’s the most valuable lesson you’ve learned starting and owning your own
                    business?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> The biggest lesson is infinite adaptability. The notion that you need to plan for every
                    scenario you can possibly think of and have the systems to be able to manage that, with the
                    understanding that it won’t work that way.

                   <b>What’s a common misconception about the business community?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> I think a big misconception is that we could do without it. Economic development and
                    economic vibrancy is why everything else can happen. Without profit, everything else goes
                    downhill. If every business around here didn’t make a profit, nobody would have a job, nobody
                    would be able to have families, or afford an education... nobody would have the arts. Money has
                    to come from somewhere. Growing the economic development of any place in the United States
                    is to the benefit of everybody. And it’s not without things that need to be polished and tweaked.
                    But we can fix those things and make improvements. But prosperity comes from profit and it
                    benefits everybody.

                    government administrations at the local, state or federal level?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> We’re always worried about the tip credit. The votes have been there, but so far no one
                    has implemented. But if they do, there aren’t going to be a lot of servers out here. You can’t go
                    from $4 an hour, plus tips, but guaranteed at least $15 to $15 an hour paid by employer. It’s just
                    not gonna work. There have been jurisdictions in the U.S. that have done it and a lot of
                    businesses closed. Especially those with longer leases, because when a government just changes
                    the ground rules of how your business model works, you're stuck.

                   <b>Has providing health insurance impacted you?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> We pay a portion of the ever increasing health care cost, and the employee pays a portion.
                    Someone told me-- and this was eight years ago-- if you think the price of healthcare is ever
                    going down, it’s not happening. And it’s gone up every single year, often double digits.

                   <b>Is there anything else you want to share with the MoCo community?</b>
                   <br/>
                   <i><u>Geoff:</u></i> I believe you should support businesses in your community and your neighborhoods;
                    they bring vibrancy, employment, prosperity, and they generate a lot in taxes. Sales tax alone. If
                    I had a profit margin on the level of the sales tax generation, I'd open up 100 restaurants without
                    a doubt. I’d borrow capital and generate thousands of jobs, but the margins are low. Sometimes
                    people think these small businesses are just printing money and it’s just not the case. And we
                    need customers to enjoy our services, so that we can survive in the long term and employ lots of
                    people.
