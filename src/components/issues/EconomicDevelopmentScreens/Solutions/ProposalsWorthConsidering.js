        <h2>Early Childhood Education</h2>
        <p>Learning starts at birth, so educational programs should start early. Studies show that 
          <a href="https://www.educationcorner.com/importance-of-early-childhood-education.html"> children who engage in formal or informal 
          education in a home setting arrive at school ready to learn and succeed.</a> Access to education at an early age is also 
          essential for closing the vocabulary gap and can make the difference in a child’s performance on standardized language tests. 
          While we’ve made inroads here through programs, like Baby Steps, which is a program that connects new parents to community health 
          services and provides follow-up consultation, we could do more.

        </p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>Online Early Childhood Education Programs</h4>
            <p>A 2015 study by Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia found that 
              <a href="https://www.einstein.edu/news/toddlertweetsmaybenotsofaroff"> up to half of young children under a year-old use smart phones and 
              tablets to watch video games, use apps, and scroll the screen.</a> With this in mind, 
              we should provide online educational programs for children ages 0-4. The county should work with early learning 
              providers, education advocates, and technology firms to provide online resources to expose more children to 
              learning at an earlier age.</p>
            <h4>Implement Universal Pre-K</h4>
            <p>For a decade, Maryland has talked about creating universal pre-K for 4-year-olds and to this day, we’re just part of the way there. 
              We <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OLO/Resources/Files/2017%20Reports/OLOReport2017_7PreKinMontgomeryCountyandinOtherJurisdictions.pdf">
              have more than 13,000 4-year-olds in the county</a>, but only 4,860 available pre-K slots that are considered high-quality programs, 
              including both half-day and school-day programs. The county should move towards implementing universal pre-K starting with Title 1 
              schools. 13 To get there, we should: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Make better use of high-quality private and faith-based programs to expand access to as many kids as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Expand public-private partnerships that are collaborative and productive, with help from the business community to 
                  fund more pre-K slots and increase capacity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Experiment with the use of Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) also known as Pay for Success financing to expand capacity 
                  within the community to fulfill this social need. This performance-driven payment model originated in the UK eight 
                  years ago and matches state and local governments with nonprofit service providers and private funding. Utah was the 
                  first to apply the concept to early learning. In partnership with United Way of Salt Lake and private funders, Utah was 
                  able to <a href="https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/social-impact-bonds-early-childhood-education-utah/">expand 
                  high-quality pre-K to more low-income families than it otherwise would have been able to fund on its own.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Grow our economy and create jobs to expand our tax base to increase funding for education.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>School Capacity</h2>
        <p>One challenge preventing our ability to close the achievement gap is school capacity. We need to create a 
          learning environment where all students can learn and stop relying on portable classroom trailers to accommodate 
          our growing student population. A greater number of students today have more educational needs and demand more support 
          and resources to be successful in the classroom.

        </p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>Classrooms Not Trailers</h4>
            <p>A growing population and lack of sufficient resources has led to our overcrowding problem and resulted in students 
              being educated in trailers instead of classrooms. Overcrowded classrooms negatively affect learning and cause students 
              to struggle to learn. We have to build and modernize our schools and move kids from trailers to classrooms. This starts 
              with reprioritizing spending. About <a href="https://apps.montgomerycountymd.gov/BASISCAPITAL/Common/Index.aspx">25 percent 
              of the county’s funding of our capital budget goes toward public schools </a>
              for construction and maintenance for both new and ongoing projects with expenditures projected over a six-year period. We 
              should reprioritize spending within our capital budget to ensure we have the funds necessary to complete school construction 
              projects without delay.</p>

            <h4>More State Aid</h4>
            <p>State aid is a critical part of ensuring we’re able to maintain instructional and operational expectations as well 
              as to make capacity-related improvements. Montgomery County now ranks among the third lowest counties in the percent of 
              state funding it receives for public school funding – 
              <a href="http://dls.maryland.gov/pubs/prod/InterGovMatters/LocFinTaxRte/Overview-of-Maryland-Local-Governments-2018.pdf">
              equivalent to $5,360 per student of the $16,499 total per student </a>
              funding the county spends. When it comes to public school construction, 
              Montgomery <a href="http://www.theseventhstate.com/?p=7618">County gets less state aid per student 
              than all but a handful of other counties.</a> Our county government should work with our 
              state delegation to secure more funding and ensure we get our fair share, because an investment in Montgomery County 
              is an investment in the state of Maryland.</p>

            <h4>Free Ride On Buses</h4>
            <p>Private schools solicit donations from alumni and local businesses when they’re in need of funding for big initiatives, 
              like a new wing to accommodate more students, to expand programming, or to make technology investments. There’s no reason 
              we couldn’t do the same for our public schools and forge a closer relationship with our business community as a result. 
              The <a href="https://foundationebr.org/">Foundation for East Baton Rouge School System</a> in Louisiana started a foundation to 
              link schools to the business community. Our country should establish an independent MoCo4Schools Foundation to help fund significant investments to our public schools, 
              such as expanding pre-K, funding needed capital projects, or to provide more vocational programs that will supplement public 
              investment and further improve our public schools. The goal will be to establish an educational endowment, with funding from 
              individuals and businesses that will receive tax benefits for their donations in return. 
              The endowment will be invested to grow the principal in order to generate additional revenue and establish a new funding 
              stream for our public schools.</p>

        <h2>Telemedicine in Schools</h2>
        <p>One in five school-aged children <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/one-five-children-mental-illness-schools-often-dont-help">suffer from mental illness</a>. 
        MCPS should put telemedicine in our schools to help school nurses be 
          even more effective. Telemedicine technology will provide students the ability to remotely access health or mental health services, 
          with the help of a school nurse, anytime during school hours, with the goal to keep children in schools so they aren’t being sent 
          home for minor illnesses. Each school nurse has a cart with a high-resolution computer monitor and videoconferencing tools so that 
          they can connect with physicians to examine students. This technology allows school nurses to quickly rule out a contagious illness 
          like pink eye, diagnose the student, provide prescriptions to your local pharmacy, if necessary, and save parents time off of work. 
          Five Howard County public schools have been offering a telemedicine program since 2016, resulting in 
          <a href="http://masbhc.org/telemedicine-in-howard-county-featured-in-the-washington-post/">98 percent of students going back to class</a>. 
          In Burke County, North Carolina, 26 schools are offering telemedicine, with 
          <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/portable-telemedicine-tech-keeps-kids-school-and-quadruples-visits">89 percent of students 
          returning to class after treatment.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        Telemedicine will also help ensure MCPS children have access to high quality healthcare. Telemedicine has proven to be an effective tool in 
        helping bring access to medical care in rural and underprivileged communities that may not otherwise have been able to. In the case of Howard 
        County, for example, they <a href="http://masbhc.org/telemedicine-in-howard-county-where-are-we-today/">partnered with Howard County General Hospital</a> to 
        allow them to offer services at no cost when families don’t have insurance. 
        At least 18 states have <a href="http://www.fsmb.org/siteassets/advocacy/key-issues/telemedicine_policies_by_state.pdf">authorized Medicaid reimbursement for 
        telemedicine services at schools</a>. 
        Pew <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2017/01/04/telemedicine-in-schools-helps-keep-kids-in-the-classroom">reports</a> that 
        schools have expanded their telemedicine 
        offerings to help support a wide variety of conditions from mental health to speech pathology. Parents have been pleased with the progress. A Howard County 
        parent <a href="https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2017/04/telemedicine-helps-keep-students-school">praised the new technology</a>: 
        “Not having to pull my child out of school and take him to the pediatrician is a huge benefit.”
