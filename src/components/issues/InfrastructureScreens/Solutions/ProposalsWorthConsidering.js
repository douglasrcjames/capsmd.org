        <hr className="m-width"/>
        <h2>Transportation: Short-Term Solutions</h2>
        <p>It starts with improving Montgomery County’s transportation network from public transit, to roadways, 
          to bike paths and pedestrian-friendly design improvements. It’s time to institute recommendations that 
          have long been studied.</p>
            <div className="l-container">
                <h4>Free Ride On Buses</h4>
                <p>Investment in public transit is key to enhancing economic and social mobility, especially among low-income residents, seniors, 
                  and others who lack a car or are unable to drive. Our Ride On bus system boasts close to 80 local routes strategically aligned with 
                  our Metro stations to promote multimodal transport. However, ridership on Ride On buses has declined by 25 percent from 
                  <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OMB/Resources/Files/omb/pdfs/fy11/psp_pdf/tns.pdf"> 2008</a> to 
                  <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OMB/Resources/Files/omb/pdfs/FY19/psp_pdf/48-TransitServices-FY2019-APPR-Publication-Report.pdf"> 2018</a>.
                   Ride On buses should be free to boost ridership and also to accelerate boarding and improve trip efficiency.</p>
               
                <h4>Electric Buses (E-buses)</h4>
                <p>E-buses are cleaner, healthier and cheaper to run compared to buses running on fossil fuels, like diesel. 
                  When the county makes future bus purchases, including replacing its school buses, 
                  they should be electric to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.</p>

                <h4>Replace Certain Ride On Bus Routes with Smaller Passenger Vans</h4>
                <p>The downward ridership trend of Ride On buses means it’s also time we reevaluate our county’s investment in big buses, especially for routes 
                  with historically low ridership that have fewer than 500 daily riders. If we can’t improve ridership by making Ride On buses free, let’s assess 
                  whether it makes good fiscal sense to spend many millions of dollars on big diesel buses that cost more to operate and pollute our air when we 
                  could be buying smaller, more affordable Ride On vans that could serve our needs for less.</p>

                <h4>Adaptive “Smart” Traffic Lights</h4>
                <p>We need more adaptive traffic lights that adjust based on real-time traffic conditions, using computer software to transform our daily commutes by 
                  making sure inefficiencies never happen. They alone could cut 15 minutes off commute times each way (30 minutes per day) as well as lower blood pressure.
                   In 2013, Los Angeles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/us/to-fight-gridlock-los-angeles-synchronizes-every-red-light.html">became the first local jurisdiction
                    to adapt all its 4,500 traffic lights in attempting to reduce gridlock.</a> As a result, traffic flow became 16 percent faster, with delays at major intersections down 12 percent. Additionally, the fast-growing city of Bellevue, Washington <a href="http://time.com/3845445/commuting-times-adaptive-traffic-lights/">
                   installed adaptive traffic lights at nearly 200 intersections</a> and experienced a reduction in travel times of up to 43 percent during peak hours. The system is 
                    estimated to save drivers between $9 million and $12 million annually in productivity and time saved. This is real progress that should happen here. 
                    Adaptive traffic lights won’t ease traffic volume, but will help ease congestion.</p>

                <h4>Fewer Studies: Free Funds for Transportation Improvements</h4>
                <p>While safety-related traffic studies are essential and must continue, there are studies routinely completed that should hold a lower priority. 
                  According to CountyStat, we have <a href="https://reports.data.montgomerycountymd.gov/countystat/objective/transportation">
                  273 traffic studies pending.</a> How much are we spending on data collection and analysis when we likely don’t have the 
                  funds for non-safety related improvements on our roadways? These studies don’t usually lead to immediate action, so the original study can quickly become 
                  obsolete. Let’s instead spend the money on resurfacing every county road within the next 20 years, eliminating potholes to improve traffic flow throughout 
                  the county. Every dollar spent on studies means $1 less we can spend on services people need and want.</p>
                
                <h4>Reduce the Number of Right Turn Restrictions</h4>
                <p>Some transportation restrictions make sense as a matter of public safety, especially during peak travel times, but not all of them make sense 
                  to enforce at all times of the day. Right turn restrictions are one example. We should review whether we should eliminate right turn restrictions 
                  at certain intersections after 7:00pm to speed up traffic and reduce congestion. 
                  Imposing around-the-clock right turn restrictions unnecessarily restricts traffic flow when there’s minimal traffic on the roadway.</p>

                <h4>Improve Pedestrian Safety</h4>
                <p>There are inexpensive steps we can take now to make our streets and communities more pedestrian-friendly. The county should clearly mark crosswalks 
                  with bright paint to enhance visibility and strictly enforcing speed restrictions to ensure pedestrian safety.</p>
                
                <h4>Sweep the Streets</h4>
                <p>Right now, our curbed roadways are swept about once or twice a year, depending on the road. As a result, debris gets trapped and clogs flood gutters,
                   storm drains and catch basins, leading to roadway flooding during periods of heavy rain. When a roadway floods, it restricts access and causes traffic
                    congestion. The county should work with state government transportation officials to increase the number of times our roads are swept.</p>

                <h4>Dedicated Bus Lanes</h4>
                <p>The best way to promote public transit use is to make motorists see transit as a better alternative than driving. Yet plans passed unanimously by County 
                  Council to create a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network over five years ago have been met with delays and calls for more studies. Let’s ensure discussion ends 
                  in progress and action. We need to have an open, transparent conversation to address community concerns and consider alternatives in plan design followed 
                  by swift action to make this project a reality. The county should work with the state to create dedicated bus lanes on certain highways, like I-270, during
                   morning and afternoon rush hour and ensure plans to create a BRT on Route 29 remain a priority.</p>

                <h4>Encourage More Employers to Allow Employees to Telework</h4>
                <p>The county should promote flexible work schedules, especially inside county government, and encourage private businesses to provide more telecommuting options.</p>

                <h4>Reversible Lanes on I-270</h4>
                <p>Let’s push the state to finally put reversible lanes on I-270 to fix traffic issues and improve air quality through reduced greenhouse gas emissions that county 
                  officials have discussed for years, without action, if determined to be mathematically feasible. Reversible lanes could ease traffic flow, reduce congestion, and 
                  improve traffic safety without adding the express toll lanes proposed by Governor Hogan.</p>

                <h4>Lobby Our Congressional Delegation to Change Federal Regulation on High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes</h4>
                <p>If we had the ability to experiment with reducing HOV (also called carpool) lane restrictions from our spurs or ramps on I-270 and 
                  reducing HOV times from three hours to one hour, we might actually be able to improve traffic flow. HOV lanes could cause congestion when
                   underutilized, because they reduce the number of lanes and diminish capacity. We should re examine whether we need three hours of HOV lane 
                   access and whether we could get by with fewer hours, and then lobby our Congressional Delegation to change federal regulation to grant us the authority to make adjustments.</p>

                <h4>Ensure Projects are Done On Time and On Budget</h4>
                <p>Only <a href="https://reports.data.montgomerycountymd.gov/en/stat/goals/pxi6-z29f/4yfe-c7au/93xj-8ezx"> 25 percent of our transportation capital improvement projects 
                  are completed within three months of their projected timeline. </a> 
                  This is unacceptable–for every project that goes over, we pay more. We must do better, including greater oversight, 
                  improved inter-agency coordination, and more timely regulatory and permitting reviews. Most of all, we need a system that drives down construction costs.</p>

        <h2>Transportation: An Intermediate Solution</h2>

        <p>We need a modern public transportation system that can move more people efficiently while lowering operating costs. Ridesharing companies like Uber and 
          Lyft are changing how we travel and our public transportation system must adapt to these new technologies or be left in the dust. Our county leaders seem 
          reluctant to recognize these new trends or incorporate them into transportation planning in meaningful ways. Can we afford to throw more money at an outdated 
          transportation system and hope more people will come around to using it? It just doesn’t make good fiscal sense and won’t solve our transportation challenges. 
          Consider this:</p>

          <ul>
              <li>
                Arlington, Texas took an unconventional step when it&nbsp;
                <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17109708/via-arlington-texas-rideshare-app-replaces-bus">
                  replaced its entire bus fleet with an app-based ride-sharing service.&nbsp;
                </a> 
                Riders can request a commuter van through an app on their smartphone and be picked up and taken to and from their destination 
                for a cost of $3 per ride.
              </li>
              <li>
                Summit, New Jersey is also experimenting with ride-sharing. 
                <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13147680/uber-new-jersey-free-ride-parking-lot-train-commute">
                &nbsp;It subsidizes ride-sharing services through Uber
                </a>, 
                which transport 
                commuters to and from the train station.
              </li>
              <li>
                Altamonte Springs, Florida now 
                <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/1/12735666/uber-altamonte-springs-fl-public-transportation-taxi-system">
                &nbsp;uses subsidized Uber rides
                </a>
                , entirely replacing its public transit system with ride-sharing technology.
              </li>
              <li>
                Columbus, Ohio now has a <a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/12/smart-city-columbus-prenatal-ride-hailing/579082/">pilot program </a>
                providing free rides to doctors to pregnant women and new mothers who are enrolled in Medicaid.
              </li>
          </ul>

        <p>The county should consider eventually replacing Ride On buses with smaller passenger vans on bus routes with lower than average ridership to free road 
          space and eliminate empty buses. Riders would then have the option to summon a shared Ride On a van from a mobile app, and software will immediately estimate 
          route demand and match riders with other passengers traveling at the same time and in the same direction – a system similar to 
          <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-rival-viavan-just-launched-in-london-2018-4?r=UK">
            one used in London.
          </a> &nbsp;
          A shared Ride On van service will eliminate the hassle of walking to a central bus stop and waiting for a bus that only takes you near your destination, not all the way 
          there—particularly important for senior and disabled riders.</p>
        
        <p>The county should also review options for how a ride-sharing service like this one could transform our paratransit services for low-income, 
          older, and disabled populations into a more efficient, on-demand service. Instead of having to schedule rides well in advance and given a window of 
          time to be picked up, riders could use a similar mobile app to have wheelchair accessible paratransit service pick them up at their door when they need 
          it, without a long wait. In addition, riders could also summon a ride-share by telephone if they can’t download a mobile app and have the option of paying 
          in cash or by credit card.</p>

        <p>Most of all, these transportation improvements would make use of our existing fleet of passenger 
          vans and would only be required to add more vans to the fleet as demand warra
          No bus drivers would lose their jobs in the process and instead would have the option of being 
          van drivers for the ride-sharing service. A win-win for Montgomery County!</p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Transportation: Long-Term Solutions</h2>
        <p>Transportation is woefully underfunded. Maryland must demand more federal transit funding! 
          Members of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) board should band together 
          and declare a “state of emergency” like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-declares-a-state-of-emergency-for-the-subway.html">Governor Cuomo did for the Metropolitan Transit Authority</a> – 
          strongly advocating for the need to fix the New York City subway system. It has taken decades, but the 
          state will now be providing dedicated Metro funding. We applaud Governor Hogan for signing legislation to 
          provide $167 million a year for Metro. Montgomery County should take the lead in calling for more transportation 
          dollars to support our public transit system, which is in serious need of modernization. We need a transportation 
          system across all levels of government that prioritizes economic, social, and nonprofit need. This must be a long-term 
          priority in order to realize long-term solutions that are necessary for our county’s future economic competitiveness.
        </p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>Extend the Metro Red Line to Clarksburg</h4>
            <p>The county should work with our federal, regional, and state officials to extend the Metro Red Line to Clarksburg. 
              The Shady Grove stop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shady_Grove_station">opened in 1984</a>. That's 35 years ago! Virtually every other line of the Metro has been extended 
              since while Upcounty does not have a viable option.</p>
            <h4>Free Ride On Buses</h4>
            <p>The county should consider making WMATA buses free within the county on a trial basis in order to boost ridership and 
              to encourage greater public transit use.</p>
            <h4>Follow Through on Master Plans</h4>
            <p>The county should follow through on building transportation projects contained in our Master Plans and make good on past promises, 
              the same way we honor our promise of pensions for county employees. This includes addressing Upcounty development and traffic issues, 
              such as expanding I-270 between Frederick and Germantown, 
              and supporting the Corridor Cities Transitway (CCT) and road-based alternatives.</p>
