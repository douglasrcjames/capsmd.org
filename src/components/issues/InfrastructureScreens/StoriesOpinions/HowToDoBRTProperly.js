        <h1>How to Do BRT Properly</h1>
       
        <p>
            For over a decade, Montgomery County has been studying bus rapid transit, a 
            kind of bus service that’s faster and more reliable. Construction is underway 
            on the first phase of what could be a countywide system: Flash, an 11-mile line 
            between downtown Silver Spring and Burtonsville. Meanwhile, across the Potomac 
            River, two Northern Virginia communities funded, built, and are now operating a 
            BRT line of their own during the same amount of time. What can we learn from them?
        </p>

        <p>
            Route 1 in Alexandria, also known as Richmond Highway, doesn’t look all that 
            different from many parts of Montgomery County. Along the wide, busy road are 
            all the familiar suburban sights: strip malls, car dealerships, and self-storage 
            places. The dust is still settling on Potomac Yard, a mile-long development of 
            brick-faced townhomes and condominiums that 
            straddles the highway on both sides, and signs at the corner excitedly point to
            model houses. There are a lot of cars on Route 1, and traffic can back up seemingly out of nowhere.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            That is, unless you’re riding the bus. Down the middle of Route 1 is a wide, lushly landscaped median 
            with two transit-only lanes, where bright blue Metroway buses hustle through the congestion on either 
            side. At stoplights, a special signal lets the bus pass ahead of the adjacent cars. 
            Every few blocks, they stop at matching blue structures with curved roofs, collecting passengers who 
            queue up at bumpy sidewalk tiles you might recognize from Metro stations.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            Grab one of these buses and it will take you north into Arlington County, where the transit lanes veer off 
            Richmond Highway and past new office buildings hosting the offices of companies like Lidl, Bloomberg BNA, 
            and the National Industries for the Blind. It’s not long until you reach Crystal City and Pentagon City, the northern terminus of the line, 
            where this fall Ama-zon’s new headquarters will open for business. The five-mile trip takes just 24 minutes, 
            one-quarter less than local buses serving the same corridor.

            This is the vision the city of Alexandria and Arlington County first laid out almost 20 years ago -

        <h2>WHAT DID WE LEARN</h2>
        <p>
            There are two big lessons Montgomery County can take from Metroway. 
            The first is that if people have the choice of using high-quality transit, 
            they’ll use it. Most of Metroway’s route is in dedicated bus lanes, which 
            keeps buses out of traffic, cuts down travel times, and reduces the likelihood 
            of delays. Buses come as often as every 6 minutes during rush hour, and every 
            12 to 15 minutes during the rest of the day, and every 20 minutes on weekends. 
            Potential riders know the bus will come on time, and they won’t have to wait 
            long for the next one, which makes it something they can rely on day after day.
        </p>

        <p>
            The other lesson is that building good transit can be challenging, but is worth the trouble. Metroway’s 
            original phase cost $43 million to build; Arlington and Alexandria paid for it with state and local tax revenue, 
            a federal 
            <a 
                href="https://www.mwcog.org/about-us/newsroom/2014/09/02/metroway-region-s-first-brt-line-gets-start-with-tiger-help-alexandria-arlington-county-bus-rapid-transit-bus-priority-tiger/"

                &nbsp;TIGER&nbsp;
            </a>
            grant for small, shovel-ready transportation projects to build Metroway, and some money from 
            nearby developers. Both communities set aside space for bus lanes years in advance, 
            whether by repurposing car lanes for buses, or by requiring property owners to set 
            aside land next to the street for new bus lanes. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Raising the money and getting the land to build Metroway were both politically difficult. just like in 
            Montgomery County, residents were reluctant to spend the money or reconfigure streets in an area that 
            already has traffic congestion. While Northern Virginia choose to build dedicated bus lanes, Montgomery 
            County chose not to build dedicated lanes through the most congested portion of the Flash corridor, 
            though buses will get to use the shoulders in other areas. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In return, Northern Virginia got a public investment that will pay for itself. Faster bus trips means that 
            Metroway drivers can make more trips, and serve more riders, during the same shift, reducing operating and labor costs. 
            Area residents and workers have a new, reliable way to get around, meaning they’re saving time otherwise spent in traffic - 
            and not putting a greater burden on the roads.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And by contributing to the kind of transit-rich, 
            <a

            that people and employers increasingly demand, the line has 
            helped draw thousands of new homes and hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space, 
            representing billions of dollars of private investment.

        <p>
            <b>WE COULD DO THIS HERE</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Next year, Flash will open, and with it Montgomery County will finally get to see bus rapid transit in action. 
            Can we replicate Northern Virginia’s success? Only if we’re ready to make the 
            right investments and difficult decisions that successful transit requires. As we expand our bus rapid transit 
            system, it’ll be important to keep an eye across the river.
