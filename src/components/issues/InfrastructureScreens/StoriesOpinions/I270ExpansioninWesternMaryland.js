                <h1>I-270 Expansion in Western Maryland</h1>
                <p>
                    From the overcrowded lanes of I-270 to the road-closing avalanches of Alleghany
                    County, Western Maryland has a great quantity and a great variety of transportation
                    woes. What an increasing number of people looking at the issue are concluding,
                    however, is that too often the solutions being considered are too narrow and short-
                    sighted. The administration of Governor Larry Hogan comes under particular fire
                    for resorting to 20 th century solutions for 21 st century problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most recent controversy that highlighted the administration’s approach
                    concerned I- 270. The June 5 approval by the Maryland Board of Public Works
                    cleared the way for a plan that will use the private sector in widening the Capital
                    Beltway and I-270. After the project is complete, private contractors will be able to
                    collect revenue from toll fees on the new lanes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the compromise hammered out to get the 2-1 approval by the Board,
                    Democratic Comptroller was able to add conditions for the toll lanes proposal.
                    Under the conditions, transit buses will be able to ride for free in the new lanes, part
                    of the state’s portion of the toll money will be reserved for local transit projects, the
                    state will study the feasibility of building a monorail line along Interstate 270 and
                    the state will not buy any property for the projects before an agreement with a
                    contractor is settled.
                </p>
                <p>
                The June’s vote allows the Maryland Department of Transportation to move ahead
                with the selection process of companies allowed to bid on the project. It has also
                added to momentum for examining other options – such a monorail proposal that
                advocates maintain both responds to transportation demands and environmental
                concerns in a way that the existing highway plan cannot.
                </p>
                <p>
                One of the fiercest critics of the Hogan’s highway plans is Ben Ross, a hydrogeologist
                with a deep interest in urban planning. Ross points out that the reliance on building
                our way out of our transportation problems is both increasingly expensive and
                decreasingly effective. Ross joined with other activists to form Maryland Transit
                Opportunities Coalition several years ago to examine what other options might
                better address the Maryland’s most pressing transportation problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                “When proposals for spending $10 to $20 billion on highways started to surface, we
                decided to look at what you would get if you spent that money on transit,” he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                For example, extending light rail into Charles County would have a price tag of about
                $8 billion. If you spent half of what was being targeted for highways, you could make
                all-day MARC service to Brunswick a reality and expand the line to the Delaware
                border. About $15-$20 billion would allow expansion of light-rail linking
                Philadelphia and Baltimore to Washington, DC.
                </p>
                <p>
                “This would do so much for the state’s livability,” said Ross.
                </p>
                <p>
                Rail links could even be extended out to Hagerstown, conceivably. Linking
                Hagerstown by rail could provide the same economic shot in the arm that Frederick
                City received with its mass transit link. Commercial and residential development
                would be spurred by opening a rail link that allowed easier transit of Hagerstown
                residents to the greater metro area of Washington, DC, Ross said. Furthermore, he
                noted, the physical infrastructure and rights of way to make this expansion already
                exist. Extending the rail link would require rebuilding the form B&amp;O branch from
                Hagerstown to Weverton. The tracks from Hagerstown to an area south of I-70 are
                still being used and seem to be in good condition. (Members of the Maryland Transit
                Opportunities Coalition went out to the area to assess the condition of the trail bed
                and the tracks.) The remainder of rail line was shut down in 1978 but the right of
                way is mostly intact and unobstructed. At Weverton, the right of way connects to the
                existing CSX/MARC line to Union Station in Washington, D.C.
                </p>
                <p>
                Another transportation option that has been proposed for metro areas like
                Hagerstown has been greater reliance on bus service. Some proposals envision
                dedicated bus lanes, with commuters served by electric busses, for example. From
                an efficiency and cost effectiveness perspective, however, such approaches fall far
                short of the benefits from implementing a rail solution. For one thing, Ross said, one
                driver is needed for approximately every 40 riders, a much higher staffing need than
                what rail transportation needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                But the biggest problems facing mass transit advocates isn’t the technical or
                economic issues, said Ross. The national government has provided minimal support
                for mass transit solutions, and within Maryland specifically the advocates of mass
                transit face a formidable adversary.
                </p>
                <p>
                “The actual political power of the highway lobby is vast,” said Ross.
                </p>
                <p>
                On top of the interest group’s lobbying power, state legislators are sympathetic
                toward arguments favoring road construction, he said. After all, they tend to depend
                on highways for the extensive travel their jobs require. Despite these obstacles, Ross
                says he remains optimistic about mass transit’s long-term future.
                </p>
                <p>
                “Elected officials say that voters insist on these highways. It’s used as an excuse, but
                I think it’s exaggerated. I think that voters really may be ahead of the voters on this
                issue,” he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                Ross pointed to how the real estate market already shows the preference people
                `have for using mass transit when it is available.`
                </p>
                <p>
                “Look at the office parks by the highway in Montgomery County,” he said. “You can’t
                rent those spaces by the office parks. People want to move to metropolitan areas
                with easy access to transportation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                The mass transit options with the best chance of becoming reality, he said, are the
                extensions of the light rail into Charles or Prince George’s County. Also, he said, a
                2007 plan for expansion of MARC service could be phased in over the decade. As
                long as the Hogan Administration is directing policy, however, Ross said the struggle
                to increase mass transit options will be difficult.

                <h2>A Monorail to the Future?</h2>
                <p>
                In contrast to an incremental approach of just expanding existing rail service, Bob
                Eisinger says a bold approach is needed to prepare Maryland for a fast approaching
                future that will include serious climate-change effects and also automated vehicles.
                The best solution to these problems is a transportation system that is widely used
                around the world – but is associated in this country with amusement parks: the
                monorail.
                </p>
                <p>
                For some people, the monorail may seem like a wild-eyed futuristic plan, but
                Eisinger’s professional background lends considerable weight to his presentation of
                a monorail plan for Maryland. A fixture in the DC-area development scene since the
                1970s, Eisinger is a principal and managing member of Promark Partners, a private
                equity investment, development, ownership, leasing and management company
                focused on the Greater Washington market.
                </p>
                <p>
                What Eisinger is proposing is a 27-mile monorail running up the median of the
                highway, linking the Shady Grove Metro station to downtown Frederick. As
                envisioned, the monorail link would remove thousands of commuters from the
                highways, while spurring environmentally sound development. To advance the
                proposal, Eisinger and colleagues formed the High Road Foundation, which Eisinger
                leads as chairman of the board.
                </p>
                <p>
                The High Road Foundation proposal calls for a detailed study of monorail service for
                the 270 corridor, from I-370/Rt 200 (Inter County Connector) north to Frederick.
                According to Eisinger, preliminary estimates show that the system should not
                require an annual public subsidy to operate and maintain the service, but another
                level of study is required to confirm this. The rough cost of the next level of study is
                $250,000. The High Road Foundation has already funded the first level of study.
                </p>
                <p>
                During a recent presentation to the Frederick Chamber of Commerce, Eisinger said
                the monorail proposal offers some immediate concrete advantages over a focus on
                highway expansion. The monorail could be built within an existing right of way,
                allowing the project to quickly start. The monorail could also be constructed with
                far fewer traffic disruptions than expanding the existing highway.
                </p>
                <p>
                Eisinger said there are two main reasons that he favors the monorail as a
                transportation solution for the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                First, the monorail has the smallest environmental footprint of all the transit
                solutions being considered. Especially important is the monorail’s minimal impact
                on watersheds. Unlike highways, which create hundreds of miles of impervious
                surface, the monorails are build using existing rights-of-way, and do not materially
                add paved surface area. In a when the issue of storm-water runoff has become an
                urgent concern for both urban planners and environmentalists, this makes the
                monorail approach especially attractive.
                </p>
                <p>
                Second, Eisinger envisions autonomous vehicles entering the transportation
                equation in the near future. A responsible approach to these vehicles would be to
                include dedicated highway lanes for autonomous vehicles. To do this, of course,
                would be displace the existing traffic carried by the highways. Constructing
                monorails would free up highway space to incorporate the use of autonomous
                vehicles in a safe and responsible way, he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                Additionally, Eisinger said monorails are preferable to light rail because the
                maintenance and operation costs are much lower. Because the monorail is elevated,
                it is less subject to the wear and tear.
                </p>
                <p>
                In his presentation and on the High Road Foundation’s website, numerous
                references are made to the existing monorail projects that are operating around the
                world. Monorails have been constructed in 42 urban areas around the world,
                covering 269 miles and carrying millions of passengers.
                </p>
                <p>
                With all these advantages, Eisinger said perhaps the biggest problem that monorails
                face in this country is public perception. While U.S. urban areas such as Seattle, Los
                Angeles, and Las Vegas are now incorporating monorails into their public transit
                system, too often monorails are seen as practical or realistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                “The biggest problem is probably image,” he said. “That’s why we are trying to
                educate the public and decision makers.”
                </p>
                <h2>Grappling with Landslides and Transportation Access</h2>
                <p>
                While the business community in Frederick grapples with choked highways and
                urban sprawl, planners at the other end of Maryland have a quite different
                perspective. Commuter traffic is nothing like what residents of Frederick face, but
                that doesn’t mean there aren’t transportation problems. Just getting access to
                transportation, for one thing, is a challenge for many lower-income residents, said
                Siera Wigfield, planner for the Alleghany County Department of Planning and
                Growth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “We’re trying to make transportation more available for people, because many of
                people just don’t have access to the transportation they need,” she said. 
                </p>
                <p>
                While local governments don’t want to run empty busses, it’s also impossible to get
                people accustomed to using transportation that is not being provided. In the
                absence of sufficient public transit lines, one option that is being investigated is ride
                sharing partnerships, and working with businesses to provide funding for public
                bus routes.
                </p>
                <p>
                Currently, busses are the main form of public transit used in that part of the state,
    said Wigfield, a situation that is unlikely to change soon. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “Light rail is probably at least 10 years away,” she said. “Personally, I think it would
                be nice to move in that direction, but people like their vehicles.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                The main highway route that is problematic in that part of the state, Wigfield said, is
                MD Route 220, a two-lane north-south connection running from West Virginia into
                Pennsylvania, she said. At this point, there is no immediate plan to expand it,
                however, she said. The congestion tends to be limited to times minor traffic jams in
                the morning and late afternoon.   
                </p>
                <p>
                Because of the relatively low population density and the close proximity of the state
                borders of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, planners in western Maryland put much
                emphasis on collaboration with sister governments across state lines. For example,
                Wigfield works with the Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization,
                which is the designated regional transportation planning body for the urbanized
                area in western Maryland. It includes the Cities of Cumberland and Frostburg, and
                Allegany County and Mineral County, West Virginia. 
                </p>
                <p>
                “The transportation issues we face are really regional, so we need to coordinate
                with other governments to address these problems,” she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                There is one similarity between the problems facing the far western counties of
                Maryland and the more urban areas like Frederick. Planners in both areas must
                wrestle with the impact of increasingly problematic effects of a changing climate.
                While urban planners in Frederick are looking at flooding, planners in counties like
                Alleghany are facing increasingly frequent landslides.   
                </p>
                <p>
                “All these heavy rains are having a real impact on our roads,” said Wigfield. “We’re
                having the 10-year storm events more often, and so we’re having to retrofit our
                infrastructure, including our roads. We’re seeing more landslides closing roads.
                We’re looking at a high probability this is just going to get worse.”
