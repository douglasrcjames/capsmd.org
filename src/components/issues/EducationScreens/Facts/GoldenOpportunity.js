                <h1 className="center-text">A Golden Opportunity:<br/> Promoting Lifelong Health by Investing in Infant &amp; Early Childhood Mental Health</h1>
                <p>
                    For the first time in our nation’s history, there is growing recognition of just how
                    prevalent early childhood trauma is and the profound impact trauma has on lifelong
                    development, including physical health. The seminal Adverse Childhood
                    Experiences (ACES) research continues to produce clear evidence of the key
                    ingredients that support healthy lifelong development and how trauma results in
                    complex and costly challenges, including early death. One myth that the ACES
                    research dispels is that early childhood trauma is an isolated experience for a few
                    citizens. The data clearly shows a high prevalence of these ACES that 2/3 of
                    Americans face adverse childhood experiences. While nearly one-quarter have at
                    least one ACE score, around 15% of adults report four or more ACES. It’s that
                    cumulative experience of adversity that, without treatment, lead to challenging life
                    outcomes.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, inequality and poverty both contribute to higher
                    cumulative levels of ACE scores and present greater challenges for children and
                    families, including limited access to quality care.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                    The good news is that the science also clearly points to the kind of experiences that
                    support healthy lifelong development – consistent, predictable and nurturing
                    relationships for children from their parents, caregivers, relatives, teachers, and
                    peers. In fact, neuroscience reveals that it is the countless nurturing interactions of
                    supportive adults for children that create the foundation for children’s mental
                    health – and shape the actual architecture of children’s developing brains and
                    bodies.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                    The CDC has recently published a key resource guide, entitled 
                    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/preventingACES-508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
                        &nbsp;Preventing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs): Leveraging the Best Available Evidence&nbsp;
                    </a> 
                    that provide a roadmap for communities to effectively counter the deleterious impact of early
                    childhood trauma. Six areas are highlighted: Strengthen economic supports for
                    families, promoting social norms that protect against violence and adversity, ensure
                    a strong start for children, teaching regulation and relational skills, connecting
                    youth to caring adults and activities, and intervening to lessen immediate and long-
                    term harms.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
                    These six key areas fall within the trifold framework of: Promotion, prevention, and
                    treatment.<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; Investment is greatly needed in all three areas, but especially in the
                    most expensive area of intervention and treatment. Currently, children and families
                    facing the highest risks have very limited access to quality care. There exists a
                    significant treatment gap due to long-waits lists in programs such as specialized
                    therapeutic preschools and outpatient mental health clinics in Maryland. Maryland
                    State Department of Education cites the need for therapeutic intervention programs
                    and services as one of the top needs listed by parents throughout the state during a
                    recent “town hall” tour.<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; The lack of funding and pressures around workforce
                    development represent threats to children’s access to treatment when they need it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Top researchers in the field have also offered several recommendations:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Expand early screening for infants and toddlers to detect mental health
                        issues, such as relationship disorders, depression and self-regulation
                        problems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Workforce Development: Train professionals in mental health, pediatrics,
                        early childhood education, child welfare and other related professions to
                        recognize risk factors, and ensure that undergraduate, graduate and
                        continuing professional education include content on infant mental health.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrate infant mental health consultations into programs for parents, child
                        care, early education, well-child health services and home-based services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Address insurance and Medicaid payment policies to provide coverage for
                        prevention and treatment of mental health issues for infants and toddlers.<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Recent federal advocacy has shown some significant success, as in the recent
                    passing of the 21st Century Cures Act which contains “Infant and Early Childhood
                    Mental Health” funding at $20 million for five years. While this funding represents a
                    good start in recognizing the importance early childhood mental health, additional
                    advocacy and funding is necessary to ensure access to care for all those who need it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Early strides in helping schools become trauma informed continue to be
                    championed at the State level, including legislation (sponsored by Del. Jheanelle
                    Wilkins, District 20 in 2018 and 2019) to develop statewide guidelines on creating
                    trauma-informed schools as well as a pilot program that would provide training and
                    implementation of trauma-informed best practices at schools across the state. This
                    legislation supports teachers and school leaders in having training, tools and
                    policies in place that prevent further trauma to students and create a positive school
                    climate. This legislation has passed the Maryland House but stalled in the Senate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Financial investment in early childhood still lags significantly behind other ages
                    groups, despite the strong evidence of the highest rate of return on investment
                    coming in the birth to five age range.<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; The federal government needs to prioritize
                    investment in this area, establish a dedicated funding stream, and support state
                    efforts to expand services. In Maryland, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future
                    represents a potential opportunity to increase funding for children facing trauma
                    and high ACE scores. Trauma in schools is acknowledged in the Blueprint, and it’s
                    critical that the next stages of legislation include best practices, guidelines and
                    support for schools in implementing trauma-informed practices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In summary, science is telling a powerful story of how to support children and
                    families and build their resiliency in the face of trauma. The initial intervention
                    needs to come early in life to facilitate the most powerful positive outcomes for that
                    child, family, and the entire community. Our federal and state government can lead
                    the way by integrating trauma informed care into our education system and by
                    increasing funding for evidence based early childhood mental health programs.
