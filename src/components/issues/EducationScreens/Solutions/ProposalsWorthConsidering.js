        <h2>Economic Development Through Innovation</h2>
        <p>We have all the assets to grow quality jobs: great schools, a talented workforce, wealth, access to research and development institutions and infrastructure. 
          We’ve got ready access to the nation’s capital, politicians and decision makers, lawmakers, influencers and investors. So, what’s missing? 
        </p>
        <p>Innovation.</p>
        <p>Montgomery County should be the Startup Capital of the East Coast.  Here’s how we can do that.</p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>Entrepreneurial Virtual One-Stop App</h4>
            <p>County regulations are meant to safeguard the general public, but many entrepreneurs struggle with 
              understanding these rules and the laws affecting their businesses. We should make it easier for entrepreneurs 
              to enter new markets, hire qualified staff, pay their taxes and obtain needed permits without burdening them 
              with unnecessary paperwork or bogging down their time with compliance. We should create a simple online, 
              interactive mobile app that walks someone through all the necessary steps and makes starting a business in 
              Montgomery County simpler and easier.</p>

            <h4>Small Business Administration Coordinators</h4>
            <p>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers several great programs and services 
              for small businesses, but not every Montgomery County business owner who could be benefiting 
              from them is. The time it takes to research programs and fill out the proper forms often deter 
              small business owners from using these services. The county should designate at least two staff 
              to serve as local SBA coordinators, helping small business owners identify the 
              right assistance for their needs and ensuring they meet the filing requirements.</p>

            <h4>The Innovation Lab</h4>
            <p>Local governments across the country are realizing the importance of investing in entrepreneurs and 
              finding ways to harness their innovation. For example, <a href="https://startupinresidence.org/">San Francisco’s Startup in Residence program </a>
              connects entrepreneurs with city government agencies to synergize on how to solve problems using technology. 
              Program volunteers commit 16 weeks of their time and skills. 
              Our county should create an Innovation Lab to inspire bold ideas to solve Montgomery County challenges using 
              our best minds and talent.</p>

            <h4>Celebrate and Connect</h4>
            <p>Fostering a more collaborative environment between the startup community and corporations, county government and investors is a win-win. 
              Loudoun County, Virginia routinely brings together entrepreneurs and connects them with local resources to demonstrate appreciation, and 
              to help expand knowledge and promote resource sharing within the community. County officials should regularly join companies, entrepreneurs 
              and investors from across the County to share their technology innovations and new product offerings with investors and county leaders. This 
              will help attract new talent and investment and provide the entrepreneurial community greater support.</p>

            <h4>The Small Businesses Super Highway</h4>
            <p>With the help of Google, 
              Kansas City <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/connecting-small-businesses-and-closing-the-digital-divide-face-to-face/458865/">launched 
              a program to get more businesses online by offering free website design and one-year of free web hosting.</a>
               They also started an effort to digitally map businesses in underserved communities to increase online visitors and grow their client base. 
               Now that search engines have become the primary way consumers learn about businesses, we need to help our businesses adapt to this trend. 
               The county should work with private partners to create a similar digital map and offer free online business services, targeting small businesses 
               in underserved communities first.</p>

            <h4>Rising Stars Village</h4>
            <p>Space is a major challenge for entrepreneurs in Montgomery County due to its high cost both to work and live. Cities across the country 
              are trying to fill this need by 
              creating <a href="http://siliconprairienews.com/2013/05/how-handprint-landed-in-kc-and-won-free-rent-in-feld-s-fiberhouse/">startup ecosystems</a> offering 
              temporary, rent-free or discounted working and living space. Many public officials see it as a unique way to entice the best minds to launch their 
              businesses in their cities in the hopes they stay and grow their businesses there. We should rework zoning laws to repurpose existing vacant offices 
              to create affordable housing and work space for a Rising Star Village and identify private companies that will help sponsor rent-free, work-live 
              arrangements.</p>

            <h4>Close the Funding Gap</h4>
            <p>The financial crisis effectively shut down the banking system for many small businesses. Research 
              suggests that access to funding is still a major obstacle for them, with 
              many <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/06/07/grow-economy-grow-small-businesses-bloomberg-buffett-column/85526778/">securing 
              only about 40% of the $100,000 median funding request</a>. Small business owners often resort to credit cards and high 
              interest loans to make up the difference. The county should undertake a capital assessment to identify 
              funding barriers that could be limiting business growth and 
              thwarting job creation, and find ways to better address these needs.</p>
            <h4>Ag Entrepreneurship</h4>
            <p>Agriculture is a growing industry in Montgomery County, 
              <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/AgServices/agfacts.html">contributing $287 million to the County’s economy. </a> 
              While many of our farms are family-run operations, there are plenty of opportunities to expand or start an 
              agribusiness from jam production and organic farming to food delivery and sustainable farm consulting, among 
              other exciting professions. The county should work with our farming community to create a two-year 
              agriculture entrepreneurship program to provide basic training about what’s needed to start an agribusiness 
              and to support agriculture production in our area.</p>
            <h4>Local Food Movement</h4>
            <p>There are several small, specialty food producers in the County who are eager to expand their customer base and 
              product offerings in the County. The county should support our farms and producers specializing in organic and locally 
              grown products by finding ways to source more of their products here and getting their products in our public buildings 
              and schools.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Creating Jobs</h2>
        <p>Montgomery County lags most of the Washington region in creating jobs. How can we turn that around?</p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>A Comprehensive Business Retention and Expansion (BRE) Program</h4>
            <p>Montgomery County needs a stronger BRE Program that recognizes the importance of retaining existing 
              businesses and helping them grow. This must be a priority. It’s our best defense against recruitment 
              programs seeking to lure businesses away from Montgomery County. While the Montgomery County Economic 
              Development Corporation (MCEDC) is actively making strides to increase communications with local businesses, 
              building stronger business relationships and creating a Small Business Navigator, we must ramp up these efforts. 
              We need a more formalized system for tracking the County’s performance and integrating data collected from regular 
              business surveys and site visits into actionable tasks aimed at removing barriers to growth. The county should work 
              with MCEDC to make our BRE program front and center and ensure it’s given the same time and attention now spent on business 
              recruitment.</p>
              
            <h4>Create an Accelerator and More Incubator and Wet Lab Space</h4>
            <p>We’ve got to facilitate new business growth and should be investing more in programmatic incubators that take businesses 
              from stage 1 to stage 7 within a defined period of time as well as an accelerator for entrepreneurs with well-developed 
              ideas that require limited capital and mentorship. BioHealth innovation is a terrific idea, but we’re not funding it sufficiently 
              and there are several other growing industries that could also benefit from incubators that aren’t now, like cybersecurity, health 
              technology, production and entertainment, green industries and hospitality. For example, we should be planning to open an incubator 
              in close proximity of Marriott’s new downtown Bethesda headquarters to spur growth of our hospitality industry. Additionally, with 
              Discovery leaving we should be reaching out to private equity and venture capital firms in the media, production and entertainment 
              industries and promoting Silver Spring. We have an abundance of talent in the media and production related fields. We can harness this 
              talent and create new businesses and new jobs by establishing an incubator for this industry, and market Montgomery County as the prime 
              cable production location.</p>

            <h4>Expand our BioHealth Tax Credit</h4>
            <p>Our region’s goal is to be a top BioHealth Hub by 2023, but Montgomery County needs to do better than $500,000 if it wants 
              to attract research, talent and investment. We should look to 
              increase the credit to make us more competitive.</p>

            <h4>Business Finder’s Fee</h4>
            <p>In 2010, Delaware Governor Jack 
              Markell <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/delaware-gov-touts-bff-program-at-national-summit/">created a tax credit </a>to 
              reward Delaware companies that successfully 
              convinced their customers, suppliers and partners to establish businesses in the state. The referral incentive 
              program provided both businesses a $500 per job credit. It’s a great way to encourage our businesses to promote 
              Montgomery County to their associates and something we should adopt.</p>

            <h4>Talent Recruitment</h4>
            <p>According to <a href="http://www.babson.edu/about/news-events/babson-announcements/state-of-small-business-in-america-report/">The State of Small 
              Business in America 2016</a>, a report issued by Babson College, 
              the skills gap is overwhelmingly the No. 1 issue small businesses have in hiring qualified employees. 
              While we need to better align education and training systems with job openings through greater partnership 
              between education and businesses, we also must identify national best practices and promising local programs that 
              could help address our needs, like a Wider Circle. For example, 
              the <a href="http://www.business.rutgers.edu/njsbdcnb">New Jersey Small Business Development Center @ Rutgers-New Brunswick</a> has 
              succeeded in providing strategic, growth focused business training and technical assistance 
              to support its startup community by delivering appropriate training and technical assistance to lower hiring costs. 
              This is just one example of a best practice we should consider as a model for Montgomery County.</p>

            <h4>Identify Opportunities in Underserved Areas</h4>
            <p>We need to be better at identifying economic opportunities in underserved communities 
              with greater concentrations of immigrant populations. Language and cultural barriers can 
              sometimes prevent immigrant entrepreneurs from seeking government assistance. The county 
              should work with the nonprofit community to identify these opportunities and collaborate on ways to connect these 
              small business owners with services they need.</p>

            <h4>Reduce Our County Energy Tax Surcharge</h4>
            <p>This only adds to the already high cost of doing business in Montgomery County and is a barrier we must work to reduce. 
              The county should lower the energy tax surcharge, initially intended to be temporary and sunset after two years, with the 
              goal of getting back to fiscal year 2010 energy rates, as our tax base grows. The current energy rate is especially costly 
              for our local small businesses, especially our technology-driven and data-intensive businesses and hinders our ability to 
              achieve economic goals.</p>

            <h4>More Minority, Female and Disabled (MFD) Firm Contracting</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://stat.montgomerycountymd.gov/en/stat/goals/single/yugk-3b6j">percentage of county-registered vendors who are MFD firms</a> has 
              fallen from 5.8% in 2016 to 4.2% in 2018. We can do better. 
              Surely, we have more MFD businesses in Montgomery County that provide products and services the County needs. The county should
               also review procurement practices to make it easier and less time consuming for vendors to be certified. We should work with 
               nonprofit partners and business associations to raise awareness and conduct training programs, where needed, to increase 
               competitiveness from MFD firms.</p>

            <h4>Lower Commercial Vacancy Rates and Repurpose Empty Space</h4>
            <p>Some estimates put our unoccupied office space as high as 10 million square feet, which is unacceptable. 
              The Make Office Vacancies Extinct or <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/ep/move-build.html">MOVE program</a> offers 
              a one-time grant of $8 per square feet to eligible new or 
              expanding businesses leasing up to 20,000 square feet of Class A or B office space to lower commercial vacancy rates. 
              Over the three years since its inception in 2014 through 2017, MOVE 
              is <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/ep/Resources/Files/QuarterlySummary_Q1-2017.pdf">credited with bringing 45 new office tenants and 
              hundreds of new jobs to Montgomery County</a>. Given the program’s success and our persistently high vacancy rates, we need to 
              be more aggressive in our approach to lower them. The county should put a plan together to double the one-time grant amount 
              from $8 per square feet to $16 per square feet, with clear performance standards in place to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent effectively 
              and vacancy rates decline. In addition, we should review county zoning laws to identify opportunities where we could repurpose empty commercial space for other purposes.</p>

            <h4>Look Local First Campaign</h4>
            <p>The Greater Des Moines Partnership launched 
              its <a href="https://www.dsmpartnership.com/growing-business-here/business-resources/buy-local">Look Local First Campaign</a> and 
              discovered that by shifting 5% of spending to local businesses 
              and vendors it could generate more than $1 billion in economic benefit. They relied on an aggressive direct mail and advertising 
              campaign to raise awareness of the economic benefits that shopping local provides. Montgomery County should increase the percentage 
              that county departments procure goods, services and construction from local and small businesses from 20% to 35% 
              through <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/pro/dbrc/lsbrp.html">the Local Small Business Reserve Program</a>. In addition, 
              we should implement an aggressive marketing and outreach campaign to increase the number 
              of residents and businesses that buy from local businesses.</p>

            <h4>Department of Liquor Control</h4>
            <p>It’s not ideal for our county government to be in the liquor business. Nonetheless, our elected officials have made decisions 
              over decades that make it difficult to unwind this arrangement. The county should evaluate options to exit the liquor business. 
              We should consider solutions that provide high quality of service, excellent selection and competitive prices for all consumers, 
              including our restaurants, hotels and other businesses as well as consider approaches that foster a business environment where 
              entrepreneurs and franchises want to do business. Additionally, we should ensure that the 350 county employees who work for the 
              Montgomery County Department of Liquor Control are properly considered. One potential solution could be a well-structured arrangement 
              to sell the business to a private entity. Any such arrangement would require the firm to retain our employees at their current salary 
              and benefits for a defined period of time. The proceeds from the sale could then be used to fund our priorities.
