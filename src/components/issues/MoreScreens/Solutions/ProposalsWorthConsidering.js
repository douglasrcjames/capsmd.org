        <h2>Transportation: Short-Term Solutions</h2>
        <p>It starts with improving Montgomery County’s transportation network from public transit, to roadways, 
          to bike paths and pedestrian-friendly design improvements. It’s time to institute recommendations that 
          have long been studied.</p>
            <div className="l-container">
                <h4>Free Ride On Buses</h4>
                <p>Investment in public transit is key to enhancing economic and social mobility, especially among low-income residents, seniors, 
                  and others who lack a car or are unable to drive. Our Ride On bus system boasts close to 80 local routes strategically aligned with 
                  our Metro stations to promote multimodal transport. However, ridership on Ride On buses has declined by 25 percent from 
                  <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OMB/Resources/Files/omb/pdfs/fy11/psp_pdf/tns.pdf"> 2008</a> to 
                  <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OMB/Resources/Files/omb/pdfs/FY19/psp_pdf/48-TransitServices-FY2019-APPR-Publication-Report.pdf"> 2018</a>.
                   Ride On buses should be free to boost ridership and also to accelerate boarding and improve trip efficiency.</p>
               
                <h4>Electric Buses (E-buses)</h4>
                <p>E-buses are cleaner, healthier and cheaper to run compared to buses running on fossil fuels, like diesel. 
                  When the county makes future bus purchases, including replacing its school buses, 
                  they should be electric to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.</p>

                <h4>Replace Certain Ride On Bus Routes with Smaller Passenger Vans</h4>
                <p>The downward ridership trend of Ride On buses means it’s also time we reevaluate our county’s investment in big buses, especially for routes 
                  with historically low ridership that have fewer than 500 daily riders. If we can’t improve ridership by making Ride On buses free, let’s assess 
                  whether it makes good fiscal sense to spend many millions of dollars on big diesel buses that cost more to operate and pollute our air when we 
                  could be buying smaller, more affordable Ride On vans that could serve our needs for less.</p>

                <h4>Adaptive “Smart” Traffic Lights</h4>
                <p>We need more adaptive traffic lights that adjust based on real-time traffic conditions, using computer software to transform our daily commutes by 
                  making sure inefficiencies never happen. They alone could cut 15 minutes off commute times each way (30 minutes per day) as well as lower blood pressure.
                   In 2013, Los Angeles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/us/to-fight-gridlock-los-angeles-synchronizes-every-red-light.html">became the first local jurisdiction
                    to adapt all its 4,500 traffic lights in attempting to reduce gridlock.</a> As a result, traffic flow became 16 percent faster, with delays at major intersections down 12 percent. Additionally, the fast-growing city of Bellevue, Washington <a href="http://time.com/3845445/commuting-times-adaptive-traffic-lights/">
                   installed adaptive traffic lights at nearly 200 intersections</a> and experienced a reduction in travel times of up to 43 percent during peak hours. The system is 
                    estimated to save drivers between $9 million and $12 million annually in productivity and time saved. This is real progress that should happen here. 
                    Adaptive traffic lights won’t ease traffic volume, but will help ease congestion.</p>

                <h4>Fewer Studies: Free Funds for Transportation Improvements</h4>
                <p>While safety-related traffic studies are essential and must continue, there are studies routinely completed that should hold a lower priority. 
                  According to CountyStat, we have <a href="https://reports.data.montgomerycountymd.gov/countystat/objective/transportation">
                  273 traffic studies pending.</a> How much are we spending on data collection and analysis when we likely don’t have the 
                  funds for non-safety related improvements on our roadways? These studies don’t usually lead to immediate action, so the original study can quickly become 
                  obsolete. Let’s instead spend the money on resurfacing every county road within the next 20 years, eliminating potholes to improve traffic flow throughout 
                  the county. Every dollar spent on studies means $1 less we can spend on services people need and want.</p>
                
                <h4>Reduce the Number of Right Turn Restrictions</h4>
                <p>Some transportation restrictions make sense as a matter of public safety, especially during peak travel times, but not all of them make sense 
                  to enforce at all times of the day. Right turn restrictions are one example. We should review whether we should eliminate right turn restrictions 
                  at certain intersections after 7:00pm to speed up traffic and reduce congestion. 
                  Imposing around-the-clock right turn restrictions unnecessarily restricts traffic flow when there’s minimal traffic on the roadway.</p>

                <h4>Improve Pedestrian Safety</h4>
                <p>There are inexpensive steps we can take now to make our streets and communities more pedestrian-friendly. The county should clearly mark crosswalks 
                  with bright paint to enhance visibility and strictly enforcing speed restrictions to ensure pedestrian safety.</p>
                
                <h4>Sweep the Streets</h4>
                <p>Right now, our curbed roadways are swept about once or twice a year, depending on the road. As a result, debris gets trapped and clogs flood gutters,
                   storm drains and catch basins, leading to roadway flooding during periods of heavy rain. When a roadway floods, it restricts access and causes traffic
                    congestion. The county should work with state government transportation officials to increase the number of times our roads are swept.</p>

                <h4>Dedicated Bus Lanes</h4>
                <p>The best way to promote public transit use is to make motorists see transit as a better alternative than driving. Yet plans passed unanimously by County 
                  Council to create a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network over five years ago have been met with delays and calls for more studies. Let’s ensure discussion ends 
                  in progress and action. We need to have an open, transparent conversation to address community concerns and consider alternatives in plan design followed 
                  by swift action to make this project a reality. The county should work with the state to create dedicated bus lanes on certain highways, like I-270, during
                   morning and afternoon rush hour and ensure plans to create a BRT on Route 29 remain a priority.</p>

                <h4>Encourage More Employers to Allow Employees to Telework</h4>
                <p>The county should promote flexible work schedules, especially inside county government, and encourage private businesses to provide more telecommuting options.</p>

                <h4>Reversible Lanes on I-270</h4>
                <p>Let’s push the state to finally put reversible lanes on I-270 to fix traffic issues and improve air quality through reduced greenhouse gas emissions that county 
                  officials have discussed for years, without action, if determined to be mathematically feasible. Reversible lanes could ease traffic flow, reduce congestion, and 
                  improve traffic safety without adding the express toll lanes proposed by Governor Hogan.</p>

                <h4>Lobby Our Congressional Delegation to Change Federal Regulation on High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes</h4>
                <p>If we had the ability to experiment with reducing HOV (also called carpool) lane restrictions from our spurs or ramps on I-270 and 
                  reducing HOV times from three hours to one hour, we might actually be able to improve traffic flow. HOV lanes could cause congestion when
                   underutilized, because they reduce the number of lanes and diminish capacity. We should re examine whether we need three hours of HOV lane 
                   access and whether we could get by with fewer hours, and then lobby our Congressional Delegation to change federal regulation to grant us the authority to make adjustments.</p>

                <h4>Ensure Projects are Done On Time and On Budget</h4>
                <p>Only <a href="https://reports.data.montgomerycountymd.gov/en/stat/goals/pxi6-z29f/4yfe-c7au/93xj-8ezx"> 25 percent of our transportation capital improvement projects 
                  are completed within three months of their projected timeline. </a> 
                  This is unacceptable–for every project that goes over, we pay more. We must do better, including greater oversight, 
                  improved inter-agency coordination, and more timely regulatory and permitting reviews. Most of all, we need a system that drives down construction costs.</p>
            </div>
         
        <br/>
        <h2>Transportation: An Intermediate Solution</h2>

        

        <p>We need a modern public transportation system that can move more people efficiently while lowering operating costs. Ridesharing companies like Uber and 
          Lyft are changing how we travel and our public transportation system must adapt to these new technologies or be left in the dust. Our county leaders seem 
          reluctant to recognize these new trends or incorporate them into transportation planning in meaningful ways. Can we afford to throw more money at an outdated 
          transportation system and hope more people will come around to using it? It just doesn’t make good fiscal sense and won’t solve our transportation challenges. 
          Consider this:</p>

          <ul>
              <li>
                Arlington, Texas took an unconventional step when it&nbsp;
                <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17109708/via-arlington-texas-rideshare-app-replaces-bus">
                  replaced its entire bus fleet with an app-based ride-sharing service.&nbsp;
                </a> 
                Riders can request a commuter van through an app on their smartphone and be picked up and taken to and from their destination 
                for a cost of $3 per ride.
              </li>
              <li>
                Summit, New Jersey is also experimenting with ride-sharing. 
                <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13147680/uber-new-jersey-free-ride-parking-lot-train-commute">
                &nbsp;It subsidizes ride-sharing services through Uber
                </a>, 
                which transport 
                commuters to and from the train station.
              </li>
              <li>
                Altamonte Springs, Florida now 
                <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/1/12735666/uber-altamonte-springs-fl-public-transportation-taxi-system">
                &nbsp;uses subsidized Uber rides
                </a>
                , entirely replacing its public transit system with ride-sharing technology.
              </li>
              <li>
                Columbus, Ohio now has a <a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/12/smart-city-columbus-prenatal-ride-hailing/579082/">pilot program </a>
                providing free rides to doctors to pregnant women and new mothers who are enrolled in Medicaid.
              </li>
          </ul>

        <p>The county should consider eventually replacing Ride On buses with smaller passenger vans on bus routes with lower than average ridership to free road 
          space and eliminate empty buses. Riders would then have the option to summon a shared Ride On a van from a mobile app, and software will immediately estimate 
          route demand and match riders with other passengers traveling at the same time and in the same direction – a system similar to 
          <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-rival-viavan-just-launched-in-london-2018-4?r=UK">
            one used in London.
          </a> &nbsp;
          A shared Ride On van service will eliminate the hassle of walking to a central bus stop and waiting for a bus that only takes you near your destination, not all the way 
          there—particularly important for senior and disabled riders.</p>
        
        <p>The county should also review options for how a ride-sharing service like this one could transform our paratransit services for low-income, 
          older, and disabled populations into a more efficient, on-demand service. Instead of having to schedule rides well in advance and given a window of 
          time to be picked up, riders could use a similar mobile app to have wheelchair accessible paratransit service pick them up at their door when they need 
          it, without a long wait. In addition, riders could also summon a ride-share by telephone if they can’t download a mobile app and have the option of paying 
          in cash or by credit card.</p>

        <p>Most of all, these transportation improvements would make use of our existing fleet of passenger 
          vans and would only be required to add more vans to the fleet as demand warra
          No bus drivers would lose their jobs in the process and instead would have the option of being 
          van drivers for the ride-sharing service. A win-win for Montgomery County!</p>
        <br/>

        <h2>Transportation: Long-Term Solutions</h2>
        <p>Transportation is woefully underfunded. Maryland must demand more federal transit funding! 
          Members of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) board should band together 
          and declare a “state of emergency” like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-declares-a-state-of-emergency-for-the-subway.html">Governor Cuomo did for the Metropolitan Transit Authority</a> – 
          strongly advocating for the need to fix the New York City subway system. It has taken decades, but the 
          state will now be providing dedicated Metro funding. We applaud Governor Hogan for signing legislation to 
          provide $167 million a year for Metro. Montgomery County should take the lead in calling for more transportation 
          dollars to support our public transit system, which is in serious need of modernization. We need a transportation 
          system across all levels of government that prioritizes economic, social, and nonprofit need. This must be a long-term 
          priority in order to realize long-term solutions that are necessary for our county’s future economic competitiveness.
        </p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>Extend the Metro Red Line to Clarksburg</h4>
            <p>The county should work with our federal, regional, and state officials to extend the Metro Red Line to Clarksburg. 
              The Shady Grove stop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shady_Grove_station">opened in 1984</a>. That's 35 years ago! Virtually every other line of the Metro has been extended 
              since while Upcounty does not have a viable option.</p>
            <h4>Free Ride On Buses</h4>
            <p>The county should consider making WMATA buses free within the county on a trial basis in order to boost ridership and 
              to encourage greater public transit use.</p>
            <h4>Follow Through on Master Plans</h4>
            <p>The county should follow through on building transportation projects contained in our Master Plans and make good on past promises, 
              the same way we honor our promise of pensions for county employees. This includes addressing Upcounty development and traffic issues, 
              such as expanding I-270 between Frederick and Germantown, 
              and supporting the Corridor Cities Transitway (CCT) and road-based alternatives.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Early Childhood Education</h2>
        <p>Learning starts at birth, so educational programs should start early. Studies show that 
          <a href="https://www.educationcorner.com/importance-of-early-childhood-education.html"> children who engage in formal or informal 
          education in a home setting arrive at school ready to learn and succeed.</a> Access to education at an early age is also 
          essential for closing the vocabulary gap and can make the difference in a child’s performance on standardized language tests. 
          While we’ve made inroads here through programs, like Baby Steps, which is a program that connects new parents to community health 
          services and provides follow-up consultation, we could do more.

        </p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>Online Early Childhood Education Programs</h4>
            <p>A 2015 study by Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia found that 
              <a href="https://www.einstein.edu/news/toddlertweetsmaybenotsofaroff"> up to half of young children under a year-old use smart phones and 
              tablets to watch video games, use apps, and scroll the screen.</a> With this in mind, 
              we should provide online educational programs for children ages 0-4. The county should work with early learning 
              providers, education advocates, and technology firms to provide online resources to expose more children to 
              learning at an earlier age.</p>
            <h4>Implement Universal Pre-K</h4>
            <p>For a decade, Maryland has talked about creating universal pre-K for 4-year-olds and to this day, we’re just part of the way there. 
              We <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OLO/Resources/Files/2017%20Reports/OLOReport2017_7PreKinMontgomeryCountyandinOtherJurisdictions.pdf">
              have more than 13,000 4-year-olds in the county</a>, but only 4,860 available pre-K slots that are considered high-quality programs, 
              including both half-day and school-day programs. The county should move towards implementing universal pre-K starting with Title 1 
              schools. 13 To get there, we should: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Make better use of high-quality private and faith-based programs to expand access to as many kids as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Expand public-private partnerships that are collaborative and productive, with help from the business community to 
                  fund more pre-K slots and increase capacity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Experiment with the use of Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) also known as Pay for Success financing to expand capacity 
                  within the community to fulfill this social need. This performance-driven payment model originated in the UK eight 
                  years ago and matches state and local governments with nonprofit service providers and private funding. Utah was the 
                  first to apply the concept to early learning. In partnership with United Way of Salt Lake and private funders, Utah was 
                  able to <a href="https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/social-impact-bonds-early-childhood-education-utah/">expand 
                  high-quality pre-K to more low-income families than it otherwise would have been able to fund on its own.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Grow our economy and create jobs to expand our tax base to increase funding for education.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>School Capacity</h2>
        <p>One challenge preventing our ability to close the achievement gap is school capacity. We need to create a 
          learning environment where all students can learn and stop relying on portable classroom trailers to accommodate 
          our growing student population. A greater number of students today have more educational needs and demand more support 
          and resources to be successful in the classroom.

        </p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>Classrooms Not Trailers</h4>
            <p>A growing population and lack of sufficient resources has led to our overcrowding problem and resulted in students 
              being educated in trailers instead of classrooms. Overcrowded classrooms negatively affect learning and cause students 
              to struggle to learn. We have to build and modernize our schools and move kids from trailers to classrooms. This starts 
              with reprioritizing spending. About <a href="https://apps.montgomerycountymd.gov/BASISCAPITAL/Common/Index.aspx">25 percent 
              of the county’s funding of our capital budget goes toward public schools </a>
              for construction and maintenance for both new and ongoing projects with expenditures projected over a six-year period. We 
              should reprioritize spending within our capital budget to ensure we have the funds necessary to complete school construction 
              projects without delay.</p>

            <h4>More State Aid</h4>
            <p>State aid is a critical part of ensuring we’re able to maintain instructional and operational expectations as well 
              as to make capacity-related improvements. Montgomery County now ranks among the third lowest counties in the percent of 
              state funding it receives for public school funding – 
              <a href="http://dls.maryland.gov/pubs/prod/InterGovMatters/LocFinTaxRte/Overview-of-Maryland-Local-Governments-2018.pdf">
              equivalent to $5,360 per student of the $16,499 total per student </a>
              funding the county spends. When it comes to public school construction, 
              Montgomery <a href="http://www.theseventhstate.com/?p=7618">County gets less state aid per student 
              than all but a handful of other counties.</a> Our county government should work with our 
              state delegation to secure more funding and ensure we get our fair share, because an investment in Montgomery County 
              is an investment in the state of Maryland.</p>

            <h4>Free Ride On Buses</h4>
            <p>Private schools solicit donations from alumni and local businesses when they’re in need of funding for big initiatives, 
              like a new wing to accommodate more students, to expand programming, or to make technology investments. There’s no reason 
              we couldn’t do the same for our public schools and forge a closer relationship with our business community as a result. 
              The <a href="https://foundationebr.org/">Foundation for East Baton Rouge School System</a> in Louisiana started a foundation to 
              link schools to the business community. Our country should establish an independent MoCo4Schools Foundation to help fund significant investments to our public schools, 
              such as expanding pre-K, funding needed capital projects, or to provide more vocational programs that will supplement public 
              investment and further improve our public schools. The goal will be to establish an educational endowment, with funding from 
              individuals and businesses that will receive tax benefits for their donations in return. 
              The endowment will be invested to grow the principal in order to generate additional revenue and establish a new funding 
              stream for our public schools.</p>

        <h2>Telemedicine in Schools</h2>
        <p>One in five school-aged children <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/one-five-children-mental-illness-schools-often-dont-help">suffer from mental illness</a>. 
        MCPS should put telemedicine in our schools to help school nurses be 
          even more effective. Telemedicine technology will provide students the ability to remotely access health or mental health services, 
          with the help of a school nurse, anytime during school hours, with the goal to keep children in schools so they aren’t being sent 
          home for minor illnesses. Each school nurse has a cart with a high-resolution computer monitor and videoconferencing tools so that 
          they can connect with physicians to examine students. This technology allows school nurses to quickly rule out a contagious illness 
          like pink eye, diagnose the student, provide prescriptions to your local pharmacy, if necessary, and save parents time off of work. 
          Five Howard County public schools have been offering a telemedicine program since 2016, resulting in 
          <a href="http://masbhc.org/telemedicine-in-howard-county-featured-in-the-washington-post/">98 percent of students going back to class</a>. 
          In Burke County, North Carolina, 26 schools are offering telemedicine, with 
          <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/portable-telemedicine-tech-keeps-kids-school-and-quadruples-visits">89 percent of students 
          returning to class after treatment.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        Telemedicine will also help ensure MCPS children have access to high quality healthcare. Telemedicine has proven to be an effective tool in 
        helping bring access to medical care in rural and underprivileged communities that may not otherwise have been able to. In the case of Howard 
        County, for example, they <a href="http://masbhc.org/telemedicine-in-howard-county-where-are-we-today/">partnered with Howard County General Hospital</a> to 
        allow them to offer services at no cost when families don’t have insurance. 
        At least 18 states have <a href="http://www.fsmb.org/siteassets/advocacy/key-issues/telemedicine_policies_by_state.pdf">authorized Medicaid reimbursement for 
        telemedicine services at schools</a>. 
        Pew <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2017/01/04/telemedicine-in-schools-helps-keep-kids-in-the-classroom">reports</a> that 
        schools have expanded their telemedicine 
        offerings to help support a wide variety of conditions from mental health to speech pathology. Parents have been pleased with the progress. A Howard County 
        parent <a href="https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2017/04/telemedicine-helps-keep-students-school">praised the new technology</a>: 
        “Not having to pull my child out of school and take him to the pediatrician is a huge benefit.”
        </p>

        <h2>Economic Development Through Innovation</h2>
        <p>We have all the assets to grow quality jobs: great schools, a talented workforce, wealth, access to research and development institutions and infrastructure. 
          We’ve got ready access to the nation’s capital, politicians and decision makers, lawmakers, influencers and investors. So, what’s missing? 
        </p>
        <p>Innovation.</p>
        <p>Montgomery County should be the Startup Capital of the East Coast.  Here’s how we can do that.</p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>Entrepreneurial Virtual One-Stop App</h4>
            <p>County regulations are meant to safeguard the general public, but many entrepreneurs struggle with 
              understanding these rules and the laws affecting their businesses. We should make it easier for entrepreneurs 
              to enter new markets, hire qualified staff, pay their taxes and obtain needed permits without burdening them 
              with unnecessary paperwork or bogging down their time with compliance. We should create a simple online, 
              interactive mobile app that walks someone through all the necessary steps and makes starting a business in 
              Montgomery County simpler and easier.</p>

            <h4>Small Business Administration Coordinators</h4>
            <p>The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) offers several great programs and services 
              for small businesses, but not every Montgomery County business owner who could be benefiting 
              from them is. The time it takes to research programs and fill out the proper forms often deter 
              small business owners from using these services. The county should designate at least two staff 
              to serve as local SBA coordinators, helping small business owners identify the 
              right assistance for their needs and ensuring they meet the filing requirements.</p>

            <h4>The Innovation Lab</h4>
            <p>Local governments across the country are realizing the importance of investing in entrepreneurs and 
              finding ways to harness their innovation. For example, <a href="https://startupinresidence.org/">San Francisco’s Startup in Residence program </a>
              connects entrepreneurs with city government agencies to synergize on how to solve problems using technology. 
              Program volunteers commit 16 weeks of their time and skills. 
              Our county should create an Innovation Lab to inspire bold ideas to solve Montgomery County challenges using 
              our best minds and talent.</p>

            <h4>Celebrate and Connect</h4>
            <p>Fostering a more collaborative environment between the startup community and corporations, county government and investors is a win-win. 
              Loudoun County, Virginia routinely brings together entrepreneurs and connects them with local resources to demonstrate appreciation, and 
              to help expand knowledge and promote resource sharing within the community. County officials should regularly join companies, entrepreneurs 
              and investors from across the County to share their technology innovations and new product offerings with investors and county leaders. This 
              will help attract new talent and investment and provide the entrepreneurial community greater support.</p>

            <h4>The Small Businesses Super Highway</h4>
            <p>With the help of Google, 
              Kansas City <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/connecting-small-businesses-and-closing-the-digital-divide-face-to-face/458865/">launched 
              a program to get more businesses online by offering free website design and one-year of free web hosting.</a>
               They also started an effort to digitally map businesses in underserved communities to increase online visitors and grow their client base. 
               Now that search engines have become the primary way consumers learn about businesses, we need to help our businesses adapt to this trend. 
               The county should work with private partners to create a similar digital map and offer free online business services, targeting small businesses 
               in underserved communities first.</p>

            <h4>Rising Stars Village</h4>
            <p>Space is a major challenge for entrepreneurs in Montgomery County due to its high cost both to work and live. Cities across the country 
              are trying to fill this need by 
              creating <a href="http://siliconprairienews.com/2013/05/how-handprint-landed-in-kc-and-won-free-rent-in-feld-s-fiberhouse/">startup ecosystems</a> offering 
              temporary, rent-free or discounted working and living space. Many public officials see it as a unique way to entice the best minds to launch their 
              businesses in their cities in the hopes they stay and grow their businesses there. We should rework zoning laws to repurpose existing vacant offices 
              to create affordable housing and work space for a Rising Star Village and identify private companies that will help sponsor rent-free, work-live 
              arrangements.</p>

            <h4>Close the Funding Gap</h4>
            <p>The financial crisis effectively shut down the banking system for many small businesses. Research 
              suggests that access to funding is still a major obstacle for them, with 
              many <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/06/07/grow-economy-grow-small-businesses-bloomberg-buffett-column/85526778/">securing 
              only about 40% of the $100,000 median funding request</a>. Small business owners often resort to credit cards and high 
              interest loans to make up the difference. The county should undertake a capital assessment to identify 
              funding barriers that could be limiting business growth and 
              thwarting job creation, and find ways to better address these needs.</p>
            <h4>Ag Entrepreneurship</h4>
            <p>Agriculture is a growing industry in Montgomery County, 
              <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/AgServices/agfacts.html">contributing $287 million to the County’s economy. </a> 
              While many of our farms are family-run operations, there are plenty of opportunities to expand or start an 
              agribusiness from jam production and organic farming to food delivery and sustainable farm consulting, among 
              other exciting professions. The county should work with our farming community to create a two-year 
              agriculture entrepreneurship program to provide basic training about what’s needed to start an agribusiness 
              and to support agriculture production in our area.</p>
            <h4>Local Food Movement</h4>
            <p>There are several small, specialty food producers in the County who are eager to expand their customer base and 
              product offerings in the County. The county should support our farms and producers specializing in organic and locally 
              grown products by finding ways to source more of their products here and getting their products in our public buildings 
              and schools.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Creating Jobs</h2>
        <p>Montgomery County lags most of the Washington region in creating jobs. How can we turn that around?</p>
        <div className="l-container">
            <h4>A Comprehensive Business Retention and Expansion (BRE) Program</h4>
            <p>Montgomery County needs a stronger BRE Program that recognizes the importance of retaining existing 
              businesses and helping them grow. This must be a priority. It’s our best defense against recruitment 
              programs seeking to lure businesses away from Montgomery County. While the Montgomery County Economic 
              Development Corporation (MCEDC) is actively making strides to increase communications with local businesses, 
              building stronger business relationships and creating a Small Business Navigator, we must ramp up these efforts. 
              We need a more formalized system for tracking the County’s performance and integrating data collected from regular 
              business surveys and site visits into actionable tasks aimed at removing barriers to growth. The county should work 
              with MCEDC to make our BRE program front and center and ensure it’s given the same time and attention now spent on business 
              recruitment.</p>
              
            <h4>Create an Accelerator and More Incubator and Wet Lab Space</h4>
            <p>We’ve got to facilitate new business growth and should be investing more in programmatic incubators that take businesses 
              from stage 1 to stage 7 within a defined period of time as well as an accelerator for entrepreneurs with well-developed 
              ideas that require limited capital and mentorship. BioHealth innovation is a terrific idea, but we’re not funding it sufficiently 
              and there are several other growing industries that could also benefit from incubators that aren’t now, like cybersecurity, health 
              technology, production and entertainment, green industries and hospitality. For example, we should be planning to open an incubator 
              in close proximity of Marriott’s new downtown Bethesda headquarters to spur growth of our hospitality industry. Additionally, with 
              Discovery leaving we should be reaching out to private equity and venture capital firms in the media, production and entertainment 
              industries and promoting Silver Spring. We have an abundance of talent in the media and production related fields. We can harness this 
              talent and create new businesses and new jobs by establishing an incubator for this industry, and market Montgomery County as the prime 
              cable production location.</p>

            <h4>Expand our BioHealth Tax Credit</h4>
            <p>Our region’s goal is to be a top BioHealth Hub by 2023, but Montgomery County needs to do better than $500,000 if it wants 
              to attract research, talent and investment. We should look to 
              increase the credit to make us more competitive.</p>

            <h4>Business Finder’s Fee</h4>
            <p>In 2010, Delaware Governor Jack 
              Markell <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/delaware-gov-touts-bff-program-at-national-summit/">created a tax credit </a>to 
              reward Delaware companies that successfully 
              convinced their customers, suppliers and partners to establish businesses in the state. The referral incentive 
              program provided both businesses a $500 per job credit. It’s a great way to encourage our businesses to promote 
              Montgomery County to their associates and something we should adopt.</p>

            <h4>Talent Recruitment</h4>
            <p>According to <a href="http://www.babson.edu/about/news-events/babson-announcements/state-of-small-business-in-america-report/">The State of Small 
              Business in America 2016</a>, a report issued by Babson College, 
              the skills gap is overwhelmingly the No. 1 issue small businesses have in hiring qualified employees. 
              While we need to better align education and training systems with job openings through greater partnership 
              between education and businesses, we also must identify national best practices and promising local programs that 
              could help address our needs, like a Wider Circle. For example, 
              the <a href="http://www.business.rutgers.edu/njsbdcnb">New Jersey Small Business Development Center @ Rutgers-New Brunswick</a> has 
              succeeded in providing strategic, growth focused business training and technical assistance 
              to support its startup community by delivering appropriate training and technical assistance to lower hiring costs. 
              This is just one example of a best practice we should consider as a model for Montgomery County.</p>

            <h4>Identify Opportunities in Underserved Areas</h4>
            <p>We need to be better at identifying economic opportunities in underserved communities 
              with greater concentrations of immigrant populations. Language and cultural barriers can 
              sometimes prevent immigrant entrepreneurs from seeking government assistance. The county 
              should work with the nonprofit community to identify these opportunities and collaborate on ways to connect these 
              small business owners with services they need.</p>

            <h4>Reduce Our County Energy Tax Surcharge</h4>
            <p>This only adds to the already high cost of doing business in Montgomery County and is a barrier we must work to reduce. 
              The county should lower the energy tax surcharge, initially intended to be temporary and sunset after two years, with the 
              goal of getting back to fiscal year 2010 energy rates, as our tax base grows. The current energy rate is especially costly 
              for our local small businesses, especially our technology-driven and data-intensive businesses and hinders our ability to 
              achieve economic goals.</p>

            <h4>More Minority, Female and Disabled (MFD) Firm Contracting</h4>
            <p>The <a href="https://stat.montgomerycountymd.gov/en/stat/goals/single/yugk-3b6j">percentage of county-registered vendors who are MFD firms</a> has 
              fallen from 5.8% in 2016 to 4.2% in 2018. We can do better. 
              Surely, we have more MFD businesses in Montgomery County that provide products and services the County needs. The county should
               also review procurement practices to make it easier and less time consuming for vendors to be certified. We should work with 
               nonprofit partners and business associations to raise awareness and conduct training programs, where needed, to increase 
               competitiveness from MFD firms.</p>

            <h4>Lower Commercial Vacancy Rates and Repurpose Empty Space</h4>
            <p>Some estimates put our unoccupied office space as high as 10 million square feet, which is unacceptable. 
              The Make Office Vacancies Extinct or <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/ep/move-build.html">MOVE program</a> offers 
              a one-time grant of $8 per square feet to eligible new or 
              expanding businesses leasing up to 20,000 square feet of Class A or B office space to lower commercial vacancy rates. 
              Over the three years since its inception in 2014 through 2017, MOVE 
              is <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/ep/Resources/Files/QuarterlySummary_Q1-2017.pdf">credited with bringing 45 new office tenants and 
              hundreds of new jobs to Montgomery County</a>. Given the program’s success and our persistently high vacancy rates, we need to 
              be more aggressive in our approach to lower them. The county should put a plan together to double the one-time grant amount 
              from $8 per square feet to $16 per square feet, with clear performance standards in place to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent effectively 
              and vacancy rates decline. In addition, we should review county zoning laws to identify opportunities where we could repurpose empty commercial space for other purposes.</p>

            <h4>Look Local First Campaign</h4>
            <p>The Greater Des Moines Partnership launched 
              its <a href="https://www.dsmpartnership.com/growing-business-here/business-resources/buy-local">Look Local First Campaign</a> and 
              discovered that by shifting 5% of spending to local businesses 
              and vendors it could generate more than $1 billion in economic benefit. They relied on an aggressive direct mail and advertising 
              campaign to raise awareness of the economic benefits that shopping local provides. Montgomery County should increase the percentage 
              that county departments procure goods, services and construction from local and small businesses from 20% to 35% 
              through <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/pro/dbrc/lsbrp.html">the Local Small Business Reserve Program</a>. In addition, 
              we should implement an aggressive marketing and outreach campaign to increase the number 
              of residents and businesses that buy from local businesses.</p>

            <h4>Department of Liquor Control</h4>
            <p>It’s not ideal for our county government to be in the liquor business. Nonetheless, our elected officials have made decisions 
              over decades that make it difficult to unwind this arrangement. The county should evaluate options to exit the liquor business. 
              We should consider solutions that provide high quality of service, excellent selection and competitive prices for all consumers, 
              including our restaurants, hotels and other businesses as well as consider approaches that foster a business environment where 
              entrepreneurs and franchises want to do business. Additionally, we should ensure that the 350 county employees who work for the 
              Montgomery County Department of Liquor Control are properly considered. One potential solution could be a well-structured arrangement 
              to sell the business to a private entity. Any such arrangement would require the firm to retain our employees at their current salary 
              and benefits for a defined period of time. The proceeds from the sale could then be used to fund our priorities.
