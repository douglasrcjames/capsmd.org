            <p>
                A “major disruption” in the county’s emergency communications system on Mother’s Day weekend knocked out about 75% of the radio 
                channels used by dispatchers and first responders for several hours over two days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two lengthy outages, which apparently did not occur during any major emergency incidents, are raising fresh concerns about 
                the condition of the 20-year-old network and chronic delays in installing a new, $110 million system.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Public safety radio communication in Montgomery County was hanging by a thread for a good part of Friday into Saturday,” one 
                county fire and rescue services employee wrote in an email to county officials. “I have no reason to think what happened Friday 
                into Saturday could not happen again at any time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                County police and fire services use this communication system to respond to emergencies.  When it is not functioning, emergency 
                response is seriously impaired.  One first responder told the County Council’s staff, “We were very fortunate that this happened 
                late in the evening and that the level of incident activity for both police and fire was low throughout the whole time.  If this 
                had happened during a busy rush hour with a structure fire or two and one or two critical police incidents we would have been in 
                VERY bad shape.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The county has known about the system’s problems for years.  In 2008, the county initiated a public safety communications system 
                upgrade to replace voice radio equipment used by first responders and install an enterprise telecommunications management and service 
                tracking system to modernize communications.  Since then, the county has changed the project eight times, delayed its completion three 
                times and seen costs rise by more than 3600%.

            expressing concern that “it appears that the project team has been directed to search for alternative 
            sites, which could delay implementation of this critical project over a year.”  The current County Executive was a member of the 
            County Council’s Public Safety Committee for the entire duration of this project, chairing the committee from 2014 through 2018, 
            until he took his current office last November.

            The difference between the two is that the transit center was a transportation project while the communications system is necessary for saving lives.  
            The county needs to audit this project to figure out what went wrong.  But more urgently, it needs to prevent more life-threatening outages by completing 
            this project.  AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
