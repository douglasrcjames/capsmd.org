        <h1>The Complexities of Child Care in a Nutshell</h1>
        <p>
          The complexities of child care policy are best understood from an economic perspective. Even
          though child care workers get paid very low wages, child care is much more expensive than most
          parents can reasonably afford. (Note that

          “Daycare” has
          become disfavored. Today’s providers take care of the child, not the day.)

          </a>
          This means that <b><i>families in our area with two children in care making less than at least several hundred
          thousand dollars per year likely struggle to afford it.</i></b>
        </p>

        
        <p>
          Child care is expensive because it is labor intensive, requiring high ratios of staff to children. 
          <a 
            href="https://earlychildhood.marylandpublicschools.org/system/files/filedepot/3/staff-child_ratio_chart_-_child_care_centers.pdf"

          , classrooms must have between a 1:3 ratio (1 teacher for every 3 children) for
          infants up to a 1:10 ratio for 3 and 4 year-olds. Even higher numbers of teachers are desirable for
          higher quality and staff morale. Staffing is by far the highest cost driver for a child care program
          <a

            &nbsp;averaging about 60-80% of annual operating costs.&nbsp;
          </a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Reduced rent from government subsidized space can reduce costs by 5-10%, but that has its own
          set of drawbacks and economic uncertainties. Efficiencies through operating multiple sites can
          help a little bit, as can providing care for older, school aged children where the ratios make it
          easier to generate income for the program to offset the losses at the infant and toddler levels.
          Some programs cannot afford to do infant and toddler care at all and only provide care for older
          children.
        </p>

        <p>
          This means that the greatest economic tension for providers is pay and benefits vs tuition rates.&nbsp;
          <b><i>The greatest subsidy that exists in child care is the reduced rate that child care workers get
          paid as compared to the value of their work.</i></b> However, as much as a program may want to pay
          its teachers more and give more benefits, doing so has a substantial impact on tuition rates that
          parents are struggling to afford. This is why the debate over whether to require degrees and
          increase child care teacher pay to the be on par with public school teach pay is so heated.
          Programs are already struggling to meet the requirements of the $15/hr minimum wage while
          keeping tuition rates at a level where there are enough parents to fill the program. Doubling or
          tripling teacher pay is not realistic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, <b><i>the economic truth of child care is that it should cost more than it does, but is already
          too expensive for most families to afford.</i></b> The only way to fix it, is to alter the equation. There
          needs to be another source of funding added to the mix so that we can increase teacher pay and
          maintain quality while charging a rate that families can afford.

            &nbsp;shared Priorities Agenda&nbsp;
          </a>
          centered around solving the problem through increasing government
          child care subsidies and tax credits to support families so their resulting costs would be
          affordable, at no more than 7-10% of their total income.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a market-based solution that, if implemented, would bolster child care programs so they
          could expand to meet demand, pay higher wages and benefits to attract quality people, and
          empower parents to afford the quality child care they need. Such an approach could be
          implemented incrementally and has a demonstrated

        <p>
          This still leaves out a lot of families who need assistance, and for those who qualify, the

        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, while the providers have been pushing for an efficient, market based solution that
          would bolster existing child care programs and all forms of child care, interest at the State and
          County levels has been focused on the more disruptive approach of Universal Pre-K, essentially
          shifting four year-olds and some three year-olds into the public school system.
        </p>

            &nbsp;Providers have many issues with proposed UPK schemes.&nbsp;
          </a>  
          The most obvious flaw is that it only
          addresses one year of child care, doing nothing to help families afford care for younger children
          and infants. It is geared towards a school day, rather than the full work day that parents need. It is
          more expensive than child care, requiring a certified teacher with a degree at double the cost of a
          child care teacher. It is developmentally inappropriate, focusing too early on the acquisition of
          information for the purpose of demonstrating knowledge on accountability assessments, rather
          than on learning through exploration and play with the understanding that it is normal for young
          children to develop different skills at different speeds.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to the push for UPK, there has also been a push for higher education requirements for
          child care teachers and aides.

            &nbsp;DC recently enacted requirements for bachelor degrees for lead teachers and associates degrees for aides.&nbsp;
          </a>  
          While the aspirational goal to continue to improve
          quality is laudable, it makes no economic sense to increase the costs of the system when families
          already cannot afford what it currently costs. It’s also perplexing to tell those low paid workers,
          who have been the devoted backbone of child care for decades, that they are no longer good
          enough, and that they need to get a degree, or if they can’t or won’t, that they need to find
          another job.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are reaching a crisis point in child care, but we have not been able to agree on the way
          forward. Jurisdictions across the US are trying different approaches and having mixed results.
          None have quite figured it out.[2] But, none have yet committed to invest in their families through
          subsidy and tax credits at a level high enough that all families could afford quality child care.
