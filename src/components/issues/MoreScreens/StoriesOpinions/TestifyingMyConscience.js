        <h1>Testifying with My Conscience</h1>
        <h2>SB0489 Ballot Access, Voter Registration, Affiliating with a Party</h2>
        <p>
            In February this year, I testified before the Senate Committee on Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs in
            support of SB0489, a bill sponsored by Senator Cheryl Kagan and Senator Mary Washington, giving unaffiliated
            voters the ability to change party affiliation the same-day they vote.
        </p>

        <p>
            Last year, I ran for Montgomery County Executive – it was my first time running for public office.  It was truly a
            life changing experience which I am grateful for.  I gained a new appreciation for democracy.  Voting is the great
            equalizer. We all know it - each person has one vote.  It doesn’t matter if you’re worth millions or penniless,
            whether your 18 or 100, obtained a master’s degree or lack a high school diploma – we’re all equal.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Montgomery County, one in five registered voters are unaffiliated to a Political Party; 22% to be precise. That
            is roughly the same rate for the State of Maryland. I doubt that when an individual registers to vote <u>as an Independent</u>, 
            they’re aware that they are essentially giving-up their voice in our Primary elections. Because
            without exception, when I made voters aware – that as an Independent they could not vote on a Democratic
            ballot in our Primary; there was disbelief quickly followed by “How do I register to vote as a Democrat?”.
            Educating voters how to properly register was challenging and a disproportionate amount of our time was spent
            on explaining “how to vote” rather than on “why to vote”.
        </p>

        <p>
            Particularly confusing was that unregistered citizens could register to vote and <u>affiliate</u> with a Party during Early
            Voting; yet, registered unaffiliated voters <u>could not affiliate</u> with a Party during Early Voting. I must have said it
            a thousand times “The last day to register to vote is June 5 th ; however, you can also register during the Early
            Voting period which runs from June 4 th to June 11 th . But, if you are already registered, the last day to change
            your party affiliation is June 5 th . This is confusing and illogical. We received countless phone calls during Early
            Voting of residents saying they tried to vote – only to be told they missed the June 5 th deadline.
        </p>

        <p>
        Other voters were given provisional ballots and the false sense that their vote would be counted. <b>In my
        election, 955 provisional ballots were rejected – of those, 766 ballots were rejected because the individual
        was deemed not to be properly affiliated with a Party. I lost my election by 77 votes.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
        Another observation was that many voters do not get engaged with an election until the last few weeks. At that
       point for the unaffiliated voter, it is too late – the June 5 th deadline was a full three weeks before Election Day.
        </p>

        <p>
        Under the current laws, many voters are disenfranchised. This problem will grow as the number of unaffiliated
        voters expands. Today, registered, unaffiliated voters do not have a voice in our Primary elections, nor do they
        have sufficient time to affiliate with a Party in advance of our elections. This proposed Bill is a significant step in
        the right direction as it simplifies our election process and we will undoubtedly realize increased voter turn-out.
        </p>

        <p>
        Unfortunately, SB0489, along with two more General Assembly bills <a href="https://capsmd.org/issues/more/legislation/voting-bills">(see here)</a> aimed at simplifying the voting
        process, didn’t pass.
