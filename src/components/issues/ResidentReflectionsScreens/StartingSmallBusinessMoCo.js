                <h1>Starting a Small Business in Montgomery County</h1>
                <span className="grey">October 28, 2019</span>
                <p>
                    It was never my intention to start a small business. I did so in part because having been a film-
                    maker and stay-at-home mother, sometimes simultaneously, in the previous ten years, I wasn’t
                    sure how to re-enter the workforce following the birth of my third child. Film-making was a rich
                    and rewarding career, but the hours and the travel were hard to reconcile with my own notions
                    of how I wanted to parent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What turned into Dress It Up Dressing began, in part, as a family dare. My brother had long
                    held that there was a business to be had in the salad dressing our mother had served us every
                    night growing up and that I’d been making for my family for over fifteen years. In an effort to
                    dislodge the conversational stalemate, and prove him right or wrong, I began sharing it with
                    friends, who shared it with their friends, and soon I was delivering salad dressing around the
                    neighborhood. Within a few months, someone from Whole Foods tried the dressing and said,
                    “We don’t sell anything like this and we should.” They offered that if I could make it properly –
                    i.e. not in my own kitchen – they would put it on the shelves of the Friendship Heights store. I
                    didn’t need any more encouragement than that to take the challenge and dive in.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dress It Up Dressing is simple yet remarkable. It’s a classic balsamic vinaigrette made with olive
                    oil, vinegar, mustard and garlic, plus a pinch of salt. Exactly what you expect in a vinaigrette,
                    nothing else. My mother had the proportions just right and taught me how to make it thick and
                    creamy. What made the dressing unique and appealing to Whole Foods was that we stuck with
                    that formula, rather than following the model of most commercial dressings, where more
                    expensive (and delicious) ingredients are replaced with lower quality ones. What I love is the
                    idea that our customers can save a little time and not sacrifice quality. They can create an easy,
                    delightful dish with minimal effort, thereby making time for the important things in life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With Whole Foods as my first customer, and no business background, I reached out to my
                    friends to see if anyone knew anyone who knew anything about food. I was unaware that I lived
                    a few blocks away from the founder of Honest Tea, Seth Goldman – a local success story who
                    also got his start at Whole Foods. Seth had just launched the Bethesda Green Incubator, and
                    suggested that I join it. Soon I was learning the basics about starting a business and navigating
                    the food industry in Montgomery County, with the added benefit of viewing everything through
                    a “green” lens. That had always been important to me personally, and was something I wanted
                    to fold into the business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I founded the company in Montgomery County mostly by default – it’s where I live, where my
                    children go to school, and despite my having been raised in DC, Montgomery County is now
                    home. It turns out, our county has some unique advantages when it comes to starting a food
                    business: Whole Foods Market has their regional headquarters in Rockville, along with Sodexo.
                    There are several vibrant farmers markets, like the Central Farm Market at Bethesda
                    Elementary School, where one can often see Jose Andres on a Sunday morning. I love that
                    market because there’s a wonderful community that materializes every Sunday morning and
                    dematerializes just as quickly, until the following week. But you see there the neighborhood at
                    work: people come to buy, to sell, to meet friends, or have a first date. You see politicians, and
                    families, and when it’s over, Manna Food Center comes through to sweep up what’s left and
                    distribute it to those in need. I get to know our customers there and they’re not shy about
                    telling me what we’re getting right, getting wrong, ought to do next…. It’s market analysis,
                    literally. I find it so curious to drive by Bethesda Elementary School at 2pm on a Sunday and see
                    no trace of all the commotion of the previous 6 hours!
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Montgomery County, we also have the benefit of a county government that wants to see
                    local businesses succeed and offers several tools to help that happen. The Montgomery County
                    Small Business Navigator, in the form of Judy Stephenson, proved to be an incredible resource
                    from the start. I have yet to throw a problem at her for which she doesn’t either have the
                    solution, or point me in the direction of the solution. She knows the importance of helping
                    connect small businesses with the resources they need, be it customers, financing, licensing or
                    peers. The MCEDC and Sarah Miller, in particular, are truly tireless in their efforts to learn what
                    local businesses need and figure out how to provide it. Through Bethesda Green, I also became
                    involved with the Montgomery County Food Council, led by Heather Bruskin, which has done so
                    much to raise the profile of food as an economic engine in the county.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That said, starting a business here hasn’t been without its hurdles. Initially, learning the
                    requirements for producing a food product in the county was baffling. I heard a different
                    answer with every call and was repeatedly shuttled between the county and the state. I
                    ultimately settled on working with a manufacturing facility, rather than making it myself in a
                    commercial kitchen because I never felt certain about meeting the requirements both for the
                    state or a large retailer like Whole Foods. But the closest manufacturing facility I could find was
                    in Pennsylvania. As a business committed to “local,” this wasn’t ideal. Today, I still don’t make
                    my dressing locally, and that has been a source of frustration, but manufacturing is often seen
                    as a dirty word here, and not a priority, no matter how many jobs it creates. Plus, the price of
                    real estate makes it hard to compete on a price per square foot basis with locations farther
                    afield. Still, I believe it would be an enormous benefit to the county if there were a
                    manufacturing facility where the strong emerging food brands had a place to scale locally.

                <p>
                    Food is a funny thing because there’s such a warm community around it – it’s accessible,
                    everyone has opinions about it, and people who work in the business usually are nurturers and
                    sharers. And yet Consumer Packed Goods (CPG) isn’t a typical industry for the county, which
                    puts food businesses at a disadvantage. Were I starting a company in tech, healthcare or real
                    estate, I would have found a lot of resources available, but for a consumer brand, there just
                    isn’t the same level of experience and familiarity, so there is trepidation – especially on the part
                    of lenders and investors. This is problematic because CPG is cash intense, since you have to
                    make the product before you can sell it, and we have frequently found ourselves with larger
                    orders than we could fulfill as we lacked the cash to produce enough inventory. It’s a “lumpy”
                    cash flow cycle, that banks find too risky, even if you have committed customers and that cycle
                    can kill the businesses with the greatest prospects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It’s too bad because as banks become more familiar with a sector they can be so helpful: I was
                    introduced to one of my most enduring customers – 4P Foods – through my banker at Eagle
                    Bank. I think we were the only two food companies (apart from restaurants) that he dealt with
                    and so he figured we ought to meet. A fantastic friendship and working relationship was born,
                    thanks to the banker - who was outside his comfort zone - playing the role of matchmaker.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It would be lovely to see more being done by the county to embrace the culture of
                    entrepreneurship so those sorts of relationships can be forged. There are people doing truly
                    creative things – in the arts, in food, in technology and engineering, and yet they operate alone.
                    I imagine what it would look like to have an innovation hub, or a makerspace, some place
                    where local businesses could find affordable office space, working space and convene with like-
                    minded people, and see what comes. We learn so much from one another and can create
                    ladders by making these connections. No matter what stage your business is at, you have needs
                    that can be met by having a broader community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The county taking the lead in this has an enormous upside: we can promote local and provide
                    customers with better products as a result. Customers want to buy local; producers want to sell
                    to the larger local customers, but somewhere between those shared wishes, things fall short.
                    For example, I would LOVE to be serving our dressings in Montgomery County Public Schools. I
                    have three children attending MCPS, and we have a mission of working with schools to support
                    healthy eating habits, but it’s hard to accomplish because procurement is such a thorny maze.
                    The funny thing is, we sell to DC Public Schools, and have been doing so for three years because
                    they prioritized buying local, and found Dress It Up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I do feel the “Buy Local” idea is embraced and supported a little more whole-heartedly in DC
                    than it is here. We can do better in this respect. Here’s why it’s important: at the DC Schools
                    they actually found students’ consumption of vegetables went up significantly once paired with
                    our dressings. That’s an accomplishment I’m wildly proud of, but also, something worth
                    celebrating far beyond what it means to Dress It Up. When you buy local, you’re likely going to
                    get better quality at an equivalent price, with far less impact on the environment, while
                    boosting the local economy. Why wouldn’t we pursue that? Promote it? Facilitate it? Prioritize
                    it?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having spoken with several other local food businesses, we find is that the needs we share are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Access to financing</li>
                        <li>Access to customers</li>
                        <li>Access to infrastructure</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    It doesn’t all fall to local government, but the county should recognize the role it can play in
                    addressing all three. Little steps can lead to great big strides very quickly. What if every bar had
                    one local brew? And every salad bar had one local dressing? What if even half of them did?
                    Entrepreneurs need support – from their friends and their community as well as their local
                    government. Gary Hirshberg, founder of Stonyfield Yogurt told me recently it was “visceral” for
                    him to help emerging companies because he knows how hard it is and he’d hate to deprive
                    them of the rewards that come therefrom.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Entrepreneurship is not for the faint of heart. Sometimes you do it because you have no
                    alternative, other times because you just can’t imagine an alternative. In the past seven years,
                    I’ve faced more existential doubts than I thought I could endure. Someone described it as
                    “riding the lion” – from the outside it may look impressive, but the rider is just wondering how
                    the hell they’re going to get off without getting eaten. Had I known the length and drama of the
                    ride, I’m not sure I would have got on. That said, I wake up every day literally BURSTING to get
                    to work. I have a waterproof marker in my shower to record the brilliant ideas that happen
                    there. Seven years in, I still think my mother’s salad dressing is the best thing on the market,
                    and I eat it at least once a day. It has not been easy, but nothing rewarding ever is, and maybe
                    I’m stupid but I would happily jump on the lion again.
