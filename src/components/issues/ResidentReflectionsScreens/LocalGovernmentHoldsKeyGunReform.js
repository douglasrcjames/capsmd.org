                    The events that transpired on August 3rd and 4th stopped the country in its tracks. In El Paso,
                    Texas, a gunman entered a Walmart and tragically gunned down 22 people, including a child.
                    Not even a full 24 hours later, nine more lives were stolen by a gunman in Dayton, Ohio.
                    Covered less by the news but still vital to mention is the mass shooting that took place in
                    Chicago, just a day later, leaving seven people dead and 46 people wounded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a glimpse into one weekend in America. In just 48 hours, 38 people were killed with guns
                    in broad daylight. When there are more guns in this country than people, it is not surprising that
                    going anywhere in public is a risk. When the National Rifle Association has a chokehold
                    influence on our entire U.S. Senate, it’s a given that no significant gun control legislation has
                    been passed on a federal level in over a decade. When this happens over and over, despite a
                    nationwide movement against it, it’s hard to hold on to hope. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Perhaps hope still lives here, in America, a country that has buried more bodies than it has raised.
                    Perhaps we are just searching for it in the wrong place. While change at the federal level is
                    massively important, incremental change can often be made more rapidly at the local level. And
                    local government is vital to the structure and foundation of our country.

                    in a typical local election, fewer than 20 percent of eligible
                    voters come out and vote. Despite this, local government undoubtedly has the most effect on
                    one's daily life-making decisions about taxes, infrastructure, housing and more in our
                    communities. This contradiction is dangerous. The ignorance regarding the importance of local
                    government often leads to stagnated change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The hard truth is that with Donald Trump in office right now, and a Republican majority making
                    up the U.S. Senate, major change on a federal level would be a near impossible task. Even when
                    major pieces of gun control legislation, such as the universal background checks act of 2019,
                    pass the house, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocks it before it can be brought to
                    the floor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This reality doesn’t mean that change is impossible. Considering the importance of state and
                    local government, perhaps lobbying state and county lawmakers is wiser. After all, while no
                    major gun control legislation has been passed on a federal level in years, states across the
                    country have passed 50 new laws restricting access to guns since Parkland, according to the

                <p>
                    These laws range from banning bump stocks to disarming domestic abusers, and it can be
                    assumed that they’ve saved countless lives. It is important to be up-to-date on local government
                    bills and laws so that you can lobby for or against them, right here in Montgomery County.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Montgomery County has relatively strict laws restricting access to guns. According to the

                    </a>   
                    distributed by the Montgomery County, MD Department of Police, the
                    county is divided into two parts (Inside the Urban area and Outside the Urban Area). Inside the
                    Urban Area, which begins and ends where Maryland and DC intersect and encircles everything
                    in between, a person is prohibited from discharging a firearm, whether the gun has bullets or
                    blanks (with exceptions for hunting and self-defense). Outside the Urban Area, a person may
                    discharge .25 caliber ammunition or lower.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, both inside and outside the designated area, it is lawful to transfer firearms between a
                    parent/guardian and child.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These laws are incredibly important to the safety of our community, yet not widely known. It is
                    important to talk to your senators, state delegates, county council and county executive about
                    improvement or reform. Safety is a human right, and it starts right in one’s own community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to being informed about one’s local government, it is also vital to get involved with
                    local organizations or chapters. The local chapter of Moms Demand Action and March for our
                    Lives, as well as the DMV Chapter of Black Lives Matter, all do so much important work to curb
                    gun violence nationally and at home. Montgomery County for Change, a student run
                    organization founded right here in Montgomery County, also connects young people to
                    movements sweeping the country.

                    As a Montgomery County alumna and a young person, the issue of gun violence and the need to
                    be informed is deeply personal. My peers and I all share a fear of going to school, to concerts, to
                    the movies, and essentially existing in public spaces at all. The knowledge that a gunman can
                    infiltrate at any moment is a constant in the back of my mind. After Parkland, I began every
                    single class by examining entrances and exits, inspecting closets and room under my desk. I have
                    had conversations with my friends about not having kids in the future, as we don’t want to bring
                    children into a world that will force them to inherit the trauma that we currently carry. The fear
                    of being gunned down is real and ever present.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This fear isn’t baseless and it is not just theoretical. On August 17, Paint Branch High School

                        &nbsp;Damion Callery Jr. was shot and killed by an intruder in his own backyard.&nbsp;
                    </a> 
                    He was supposed to start college at Bowie State University in just six days. Damion Callery Jr.’s death is
                    evidence that this issue is a local one. This happened right in our backyard. The gun control laws
                    already set in place did not stop this tragedy from occurring. We cannot accept the laws set in
                    place, or even celebrate them because we are still not safe. There are still improvements to be
                    made.

                <p>
                    As Maryland residents, we have the power to demand that the state’s newly enacted Red Flag
                    Laws are enforced everywhere. We have the power to make sure bump stocks are banned and
                    high capacity magazines are kept out of everyone's hands. We have the power to demilitarize the
                    police, as well as the public. Our weakness is not knowing how much power we wield.

                    If you’re desperately searching for hope after all these senseless shootings, the hope is right
                    there, with these organizations. The hope is in our community and our state and local politicians,
                    and all those trying to keep their friends and family safe. Montgomery County is home. Take
                    good care of it and it will take care of you.
