                    <p>
                        Its that time again. A gaggle of well-coiffed Presidential candidates are seeking
                        your vote. Your vote to be won by promises made. One promise being to repair our
                        healthcare system. But a problem. Today’s candidates lack a basic understanding of
                        health care fundamentals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This cannot be, you say. For months America’s television and radio waves have
                        been saturated with Presidential candidates targeting health care’s most egregious
                        offenders: insurance companies that deny claims; dastardly for-profit HMOs; greedy
                        drug manufacturers; Stone Age medical records systems; and the Sons of Satan
                        malpractice attorneys. Acid comments about rampant Medicare fraud and illegal aliens
                        clogging the ERs fill any gaps in airtime. Are these significant problems? Certainly. But
                        none is the key driver of health care inflation. So then, what are the most basic health
                        care fundamentals?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fundamental Number One, there is no “real” health insurance, so do not concern
                        yourself with the extra tests and paper medical records. Health insurance disappeared
                        decades ago. True insurance is the concept of a large group of people pulling from their
                        bank accounts a few dollars to cover the cost of a potential catastrophic event that may
                        befall only the most unlucky. When one buys homeowner’s insurance it’s not with the
                        expectation that one’s house will burn to the ground. However, the majority of today’s
                        Americans with health insurance expect to utilize it; well-baby care, eye exams, wart
                        removals, and, perhaps, a prescription for Prozac. If homeowner’s insurance had been
                        on the same evolutionary path as health insurance for the past three decades, today’s
                        homeowner’s insurance would pay for repairing furnaces, applications of crabgrass
                        killer, cleaning gutters, and checking the fireplace flue for ash buildup . . . a colonoscopy
                        for the house.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        True health insurance was strangled by unions and state insurance
                        commissioners who, bless their hearts, kept negotiating and mandating more and more
                        comprehensive benefits . . . cleaning the gutters, so to speak. Thus many self-employed
                        American workers cannot afford the all-inclusive health plans mandated by legislation.
                        What they need, low-cost catastrophic health insurance . . . true insurance . . . is sitting
                        in America’s attic next to the dust-covered Super-8 movie projectors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fundamental Number Two, and perhaps the most important. If you wish to be
                        frugal and save money, you can switch from butter to margarine, but you can only make
                        the economic move once. Same with health care. By miracle of miracles, if in 2021 a
                        newly-elected and omnipotent President squeezed out each and every administrative
                        inefficiency in our health delivery system, lowered Medicare reimbursement rates,
                        demanded insurance companies, HMOs, and pharmaceutical firms to forfeit their profits,
                        retrained malpractice attorneys as Vegas pit bosses, and transmitted medical records
                        instantaneously through Mark Zuckerberg’s personal computer, health care costs would
                        drop, perhaps up to 20 percent. Certainly good news for Americans. Of course, it won’t
                        happen, but certainly it would be good news.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now for the somber reality. Once aggregate health care costs ratcheted down
                        20% they would resume their steady march upward at 3 – 5% percent a year. In four or
                        five short years America’s health care expenditures would be painfully back to where we
                        are today . . . then climbing from there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While erasing a few years of health care inflation would certainly be met with
                        rousing cheers, it’s the never- ending, always rising slope of health care costs that is our
                        greatest challenge. Americans, and their leaders, need to understand why the slope is
                        relentless and steep. Drumroll please, enter the heart and brain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Two human organs, the heart and brain, cause the most angst for health care
                        policy makers. Let us begin with the heart. Every few weeks the local news covers a
                        human interest story along the lines of a cluster of concerned firemen and policemen
                        huddled around under a tree, pondering how best to retrieve a stranded cat high above. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While the human heart has immense compassion, it does not possess a
                        calculating capability. Homo sapiens are quite prepared to expend $1,000 of municipal
                        labor costs to rescue a meowing feline. A feline similar to the dozens of others that
                        another municipal employee efficiently euthanizes at the county animal shelter each
                        week. This very same irrational heart drives humans to demand boundless care for their
                        loved ones. Americans are not Spock-like. There is no price sensitivity to the love of
                        family . . . especially if someone else is paying. The heart expects, demands, the best
                        and most technically advanced care available.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Technically advanced care—an oblique reference to the brain, the second culprit
                        in rising health care costs. The human brain, while acting bizarrely at times, usually
                        while under the undue influence of the only organ in our body’s southern hemisphere, is
                        masterful in contriving technical solutions to the most daunting challenges. Thus
                        percolating human brains continually conjure up new health care products and services,
                        and even if only offering a sliver of benefit, these innovations are quickly marketed to,
                        and embraced by, medical providers; a $1.6 million robotic surgical instrument or a
                        $400,000 open MRI for claustrophobic patients . . . to name just a few.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Classic retorts to the above appear valid; ever-expanding health care technology
                        serves to better diagnose and cure people, thus limiting medical costs in the long run.
                        As someone said, “A beautiful theory is often broken by one ugly fact.” For every new
                        technology of unquestionable benefit, there are scores of others with only fuzzy
                        subjective value. And even if a new technology is a silver bullet . . . all lung cancers
                        immediately diagnosed and cured . . . aggregate health expenditures would not drop by
                        the “cost” of treating lung cancer. Americans who would have succumbed to lung
                        cancer will live to suffer a heart attack, an aneurysm, or twenty years of acute dementia
                        … all costly events. Scan the obituaries, people don’t die of old age, they die after long
                        illnesses.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A specific example: let us suppose that one of those magnificently intelligent,
                        both in their research and marketing, pharmaceutical manufacturers developed a
                        miracle pill. A small green pill. If an individual, with death approaching, takes this pill, he
                        or she will live another year. One pill, another year of life; it’s an absolute. Two pills,
                        three pills, still only one year; thus, no need to take more than one pill.
                        Now let us consider the following chart:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cost of New Pill In Dollars If the Patient Pays, Will He Accept Pill? If the Federal
                        Government Pays, Will Patient Accept Pill?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        America already possesses the magical little green pill. It is in the form of the last
                        year of life, when many Americans enjoy their twilight months in a hospital with soft
                        breezes from a ventilator flowing pain- fully down their throat; well-prepared meals, pre-
                        chewed and served through a feeding tube; and, as a poised waiter removing porcelain
                        china after a fine meal, a diaper collecting table scraps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The wondrous medical technology of America allows life to be extended in most
                        medical calamities. But the cost is non-trivial. End- of-life care in a hospital is easily
                        $100,000 to $200,000 a month. The billions of dollars paid by the Federal Government,
                        your Medicare, for those last months of life must be funded by taxes. Taxes paid by
                        American citizens.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So then, if we assume one in three Americans will spend their last months being
                        drawn and quartered in a hospital, at a cost of $300,000, on average each American will
                        need to pay $100,000 in taxes to fund the expense. And the $300,000 end-of-life-care
                        cost is not fixed; it will increase as medical technology performs more and more
                        wondrous feats.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So should the hospital patient, perhaps an elderly widow, with tubes in most of her
                        orifices, incur $300,000 of medical charges to live another few painful months?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If there were no Medicare, and if the patient had $300,000 in a savings account
                        accumulated over twenty years of diligent saving, and was conscious and able to put 
                        forth her wishes, this widow might well elect to kiss her daughter a loving good-bye and
                        end her life in dignity, thus leaving the $300,000 for her grandchildren’s education.
                        Likely, her daughter would tearfully concur.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If Medicare was paying for the last months of the widow’s life at a cost of
                        $300,000, and even if the failing widow asked to sleep her last sleep in dignity, her
                        daughter may well plead . . . “Doctor, whatever it takes, please, please, the best care
                        available.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That most human plea above being the reason for never ending, always
                        expanding health care costs.
