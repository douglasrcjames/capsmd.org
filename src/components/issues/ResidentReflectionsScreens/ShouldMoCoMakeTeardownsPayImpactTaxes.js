                    which he would devote to school
                    construction and affordable housing. Opponents say his bill would depress redevelopment.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Should this bill pass?</h3>

                <p>
                    First, let’s recognize a central fact: redevelopment is financially good for the county. Old homes that are
                    sold and rebuilt generate transfer and recordation taxes. They generate more property taxes over the
                    long run if they are larger, newer and more valuable. If the families who own these more valuable
                    homes earn more money than the prior homeowners, the county will get more income taxes. Rebuilt
                    homes don’t require brand new roads and sewer extensions. They are often more energy-efficient than
                    the homes they replace. And they generate jobs in the construction and real estate industries. All of
                    these are good things which should be encouraged.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another fact is that impact taxes are generally levied only on new development. Section 52-53 of
                    MoCo’s 
                    <a

                        &nbsp;county code&nbsp;
                    </a> 
                    explicitly links impact taxes to new growth and new development. So does a
                    section of state law (Md. Local Government Code Ann. Section 20-701) allowing code counties to charge
                    impact fees. (MoCo is not a code county since it has a charter.) So do laws on

                    Three different land use attorneys I
                    contacted have never heard of impact taxes targeting anything other than new development. That
                    makes Glass’s bill revolutionary.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The politics around this bill are great: make McMansion builders pay for affordable housing and schools.
                    No wonder Glass’s press conference was swarming with unions and progressive groups. The only sin in
                    their eyes is that the McMansions aren’t getting squeezed for even more money! It’s a wonder that
                    Glass’s colleagues aren’t jumping up and down to pass this bill, but other than Council Member Will
                    Jawando, no one is cosponsoring it. One reason for that is the homebuilding industry, which beat Glass
                    to the punch by informing the rest of the council about the bill before he did and successfully raising
                    doubts about it. But momentum could change if bill supporters mobilize.

                    The first component of Glass’s bill charges $9 per square foot of net increase in
                    size between the old house and the new house and sends the revenue to the county’s affordable
                    housing program. Something like this was done three years ago through a different vehicle: the
                    county’s recordation tax.

                    premium, which is charged on the cost of a property or refinancing in excess of $500,000, and dedicated
                    the increase equally to county capital projects and rent assistance to low and moderate income people.
                    Partly as a result of Floreen’s bill, recordation taxes are projected to

                    Glass estimates that his bill will generate for affordable housing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Teardowns may not currently pay impact taxes, but they do pay recordation tax premiums because they
                    typically sell for much more than $500,000. In fact, if a teardown is sold to a developer and is then
                    resold to a new owner, it would pay the recordation tax twice. So teardowns contribute to affordable
                    housing now – sometimes by being taxed twice – and if the council wants to dedicate more of the
                    recordation tax premium to affordable housing, they can do it through separate legislation. The
                    strength of the recordation tax is that it covers all transacted homes whether they are teardowns or not.
                    That’s a fairer approach than charging a new tax for affordable housing just on teardowns but not on
                    other equally valuable properties.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second component of Glass’s bill charges the full school impact tax, 
                    <a

                        &nbsp;currently set at $26,207 with a surcharge on larger houses,&nbsp;
                    </a> 
                    on rebuilt homes. In support of his approach, Glass cites data provided by
                    the planning department finding that rebuilt homes create an average of 0.55 students per unit, which is
                    roughly 20% higher than the 0.46 students per unit created by all single family homes. Rebuilt homes
                    are typically built for new owners, many of whom have or intend to create families with children. But
                    that’s the case for many new owners, even ones who don’t rebuild their homes, and the latter group
                    does not pay impact taxes under current law or Glass’s bill. How do student generation rates in rebuilt
                    homes compare to other homes that are sold to new owners? That data has not yet been crunched.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And so, consider three hypothetical families. Family 1 buys a 1950s-era rambler, tears it down, rebuilds
                    it as a house twice as large as the old one and sends two kids to MCPS. Family 2 buys a 1950s-era
                    rambler, adds a second story that doubles its square footage and sends two kids to MCPS. Family 3 buys
                    a 1950s-era rambler, leaves it as is and sends two kids to MCPS. Under current law, none of them would
                    pay an impact tax. Under Glass’s bill, Family 1 would pay an impact tax but the other two would not.
                    That is despite the fact that all three families have an identical impact on the school system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Glass’s bill is being marketed on the basis of fixing an inequity, but in the above case, it actually creates
                    an inequity. Furthermore, while the bill is being marketed as repealing a loophole, it actually creates a
                    loophole by continuing to exempt additions from impact taxes. If a builder could add 2,500 square feet
                    to a property by constructing an addition rather than a teardown and thereby evade the impact tax, why
                    wouldn’t that builder take every opportunity to do so? That would create an argument for taxing
                    additions that would further discourage redevelopment and push it – and its tax revenues – towards
                    other jurisdictions.
                </p>

                <p>All of this argues against this particular provision of Glass’s bill. But that’s not the end of the story.</p>

                <p>
                    One theory that can be inferred from Glass’s student generation data is that rebuilt homes create more
                    students because they are much larger than the homes they replaced. (Over the last ten years, rebuilt
                    homes averaged 4,200 square feet and replaced older homes averaging 1,700 square feet.) Do bigger
                    houses generate more students than smaller houses? That’s a really tough question to answer,
                    especially since most jurisdictions that charge impact taxes charge by type of housing and not by size.
                    But at least two jurisdictions have done more in-depth research on the issue.

                    </a> 
                    Alexandria, Virginia found that low-income housing types – which
                    they defined as income-limited and subsidized apartments, garden cooperatives and public housing
                    units – generated students at 2 to 3 times the rates of detached single-family homes. That suggests that
                    low-income housing units, not McMansions, are disproportionate sources of public school students.
                    This might be especially the case if wealthy McMansion owners send their kids to private schools more
                    often than residents of low-income housing.

                        &nbsp;estimated student generation rates by housing bedroom count&nbsp;
                    </a>  
                    in 2007 and 2014. Using different methodologies, Broward estimated that single family homes
                    with 4 or more bedrooms generated 13-45% more students than single family homes with 3 or fewer
                    bedrooms. However, in 4 of the county’s 7 planning areas, the smaller homes had higher student
                    generation rates than the larger homes. Clearly other variables affect student generation than
                    bedrooms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nevertheless, Broward County’s data suggests that there may be a link between number of bedrooms
                    and number of students. That makes more intuitive sense than any approach based on housing size,
                    which assumes that square footage added to kitchens and bathrooms results in more students. And
                    that creates a road map for what to do about this bill. The council should ask the planning department
                    to study student generation rates by bedroom count. If the student generation rate increases with
                    bedroom count, the planning department should be able to quantify the size of the increase and use it
                    to calculate an appropriate tax. The tax should then be applied to the net increase in bedrooms created
                    by a rebuilt house. That preserves the nexus between the tax and student generation rate – an essential
                    ingredient to making the tax fair – and could send at least a few million dollars a year to the county’s
                    capital budget.
