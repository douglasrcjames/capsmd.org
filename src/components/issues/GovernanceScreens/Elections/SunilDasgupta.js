                <b>1. What is your vision for education in this county?</b>
                <p>
                    One of the things that makes Montgomery County a great place to live in and raise a family is
                    that we value public education. But public education has a public purpose: it is not excludable
                    and therefore must be equally accessible to all. If there is not equal access, the public character
                    of public education is jeopardized and then the county will suffer as a whole. In particular, a
                    diminished public school system will hurt the economic prospects in the county. As a
                    beneficiary of public education, as a participant in the public education system (albeit in higher
                    education), and a parent with three children in public education in the county, I want to
                    preserve the public nature of our public education system. To do this, I have proposed three
                    “big ideas” as the central message of my candidacy.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Hire more teachers, staff, and counselors so we can reduce class size, reduce support
                        staff ratios and truly address the performance gap.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Invest in student and staff health, safety, and training including mental health and
                        wellness to promote school climate and effective learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rebuild the home and school partnership to forge a close and mutually cooperative
                        collaboration between teachers and families and work together bring the resources we
                        need.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Together, they form the foundation for a strong school system, skilled graduates, and an
                    engaged community and my policy plans are all about finding the resources and support to
                    make them happen.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>2. Is there a specific issue that motivates you to serve on this board?</b>
                <p>
                    While school boundaries may be the emergent issue, I am motivated by closing the
                    performance gap while enabling students who are doing well to do even better. There is no one
                    silver bullet, but hiring more staff is step one toward reducing staff ratios; retaining and training
                    teachers better; improving rigor and content in the curriculum; targeting resources to those
                    who need it most; rebuilding the home and school partnership; and investing in the health,
                    safety, and wellness of students and our staff. To do all of this, we need a strong BOE to secure
                    resources, reprioritize, and rebalance capital and operating budgets.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>3. What specific experiences or skills have prepared you to serve as a board member?</b>
                <p>
                    I am a parent of 3 MCPS students and have 20 years of classroom teaching and policy research
                    experience, 11 teaching MCPS graduates. I have worked with budgets, financial reports, and
                    data. I have been a PTA leader and served on various school-related MCPS and county
                    committees including on health, safety, use of screens, and the Planning Board’s Subdivision
                    Staging Policy schools advisory team. I received the MCCPTA Dad4PTA Award for 2018. I have
                    written publicly on education issues (see here: 
                    <a 
                        href="https://www.sunildasgupta.com/research-and-writing.html" 
                        rel="noopener noreferrer" 
                        target="_blank">&nbsp;https://www.sunildasgupta.com/research-and-writing.html&nbsp;</a>
                    ) 
                    and testified before the Board of Education, County Council, and other forums,
                    and I founded the annual Mental Health and Wellness Forum for students, staff, and families.
                </p>

                <br/>
                <b>4. One of the most critical roles of the Board of Education is to monitor the
                    work of the superintendent and hold him or her accountable for
                    performance. Do you believe the current board does a good job of
                    overseeing the superintendent? If not, how would you improve oversight?</b>
                <p>
                    Board oversight of the superintendent is not an individual exercise. Effective oversight requires
                    the Board to work collectively. The Board can do better on oversight, but the members need to
                    work together. This is not a small problem. If elected I will try to bring a collective approach to
                    the functioning of the Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have had a few challenges lately. The boundary analysis/study has not been handled
                    properly. The internal reorganization of MCPS was not developed collaboratively. Labor
                    relations appear to be in decline. We needed more mental health support and we need more
                    teachers and staff. In my view, the Board needed to exercise greater oversight and leadership
                    on these issues.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>5. A significant body of research holds that diverse students are best served by a
                    diverse group of teachers. MCPS has substantial gaps between the demographics
                    of its students and its teachers in many of its schools. Do you believe that MCPS
                    needs more teacher diversity, and if you do, what measures would you
                    recommend for increasing it?</b>
                <p>
                    Yes, MCPS needs greater staff diversity. For students to connect to learning, they need to see
                    themselves in their teachers and in the curriculum. While this question asks about teacher
                    diversity, it is true of curriculum as well. In my view, we are weakest on Latinx representation,
                    followed by Asian and Black representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MCPS is working on targeted recruitment for HBCUs and schools with high Latinx student
                    bodies. We are beginning to develop pipelines and pathways and encouraging our own
                    students to become teachers. We must also create an inclusive climate and offer support for
                    minority teachers we hire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We must do all of these things, and commit to evaluating our progress, but the larger problem
                    is how to appeal to persons of color at a time when overall, teachers are abandoning the
                    profession. The Kirwan Commission recommends we elevate the profession of teaching to
                    attract and retain more teachers overall. We can do this by developing a model of shared
                    governance where teachers feel they are part of the decision-making process (not just when
                    they are promoted to administrators but as teachers themselves) and by offering higher
                    salaries.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>6. There is much attention given to ensuring that students are career ready in
                    addition to being college ready upon graduation. Do you consider career
                    readiness to be a critical mission for MCPS? If yes, what thoughts do you have
                    about how K-12 systems can support all students to be career ready? If not, why
                    not?</b>
                <p>
                    There is little doubt that career education should be critical for MCPS’ mission. Career
                    education is an important and viable education path for variety of professions and doesn’t
                    currently get the focus it deserves, given the current mismatch between graduates’ skills and
                    the labor market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the medium to short-term, we can offer more career programming for students so they can
                    pick up the skills and see what is involved. Computer programming, for example, is a desirable
                    skill (albeit best combined with some area of substantive knowledge) and does not require a
                    college degree, but we don’t offer robust coding classes in our middle schools, when students
                    should start on this. Part of the problem is that we don’t have enough teachers for higher-level
                    coding. This brings us back to the teacher shortage and retention issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A third aspect of this problem is resource allocation. Teaching automotive engineering requires
                    a workshop with tools and cars and higher insurance coverage. Teaching in a classroom
                    requires a smartboard, desks and chairs, and possibly computers. This is one reason MCPS has
                    concentrated technical education at Edison High School. There will be another center upcounty
                    at Seneca Valley High School. Ideally, we can try to extend career education to home schools as
                    well if we think more broadly about career education to include areas such as media production
                    and community organizing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, early childhood development is a popular MCPS high school career program that does
                    not get sufficient credit for its contribution to career education in MCPS. This is a strong
                    program available at more than half our high schools and should be promoted better.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>7. There has been much attention within MoCo and nationwide on the disparities in
                    FARMS rates and in student demographics across schools within the same
                    district. Some argue that this is the result of housing patterns and outside the
                    purview of schools to address. Others argue that the school system must address
                    the consequences because there are educational ramifications. What are your
                    thoughts on this issue?</b>
                <p>
                    If there are disparities based on poverty or student demography, these must be addressed or
                    else we will not have equal access. A public school has little choice in who is going to walk
                    through its doors and take a seat in its classrooms. This is very different from where I grew up
                    in India and a family’s wealth and income determine the quality of education a child received.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can we fix housing policy to address this? We should try to, absolutely. But it will take time.
                    Meanwhile, we cannot tell the young men and women currently in school that we are waiting
                    on housing policy to catch up before they get the best possible education. Indeed, a school can
                    help level the playing field now. Beyond the philosophical argument, failing to educate all
                    children imposes significant costs on society in terms of unemployment, health, and safety. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>8. What factors do you believe should be considered in adjusting school boundaries
                    and how would you prioritize them?</b>
                <p>
                    The controversy over school boundaries has been allowed to get out of hand. There has been
                    much criticism about the phrase, “especially diversity” in the facilities policy. Truth is, there was
                    no weighting of the four factors—utilization, stability, proximity, and diversity—prior to the
                    policy change, and the addition of “especially diversity” does not provide a formula either. It
                    quite common for government agencies to prescribe resource allocation principles rather than
                    set out formulas that are then quickly subject to obsolescence. I think all those four factors are
                    important and relative emphasis could differ between parts of the county. For example,
                    proximity works very differently in downcounty than it does in upcounty. Transportation means
                    one thing when there is transit available and another when traffic is all cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I support developing a systemwide and regular process of school boundary review and
                    adjustment to make sure that we do not spend the next 35 years of population change and
                    demographic shifts without having the policy tools to deal with them. First, systemwide review
                    is better than cluster-limited reviews because it allows for cascading changes and enables
                    shorter commutes. In a school system where nearly 40 percent of students do not currently go
                    to the school closest to them, a rationalization of school boundaries could very well reduce
                    commutes. Second, the boundary review process needs to be regularized and evolve into a
                    system of incremental change so we don’t once again face the prospect of an overhaul and
                    anger large swaths of our residents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we should time-lag the announcement of any change and its execution such that we can
                    provide stability for students. In this scheme, we assign a kindergarten school based on
                    geography and birth. On the first day of kindergarten we assign the child a middle school, and
                    on the first day of middle school we assign a high school. These do not change, ever. When we
                    do this again, we make adjustments we need. For siblings who might be separated as a result,
                    we offer the easy possibility of changing the school assignment for the older child to the new
                    school. And most importantly, we alter our capital spending priorities to invest in underenrolled
                    schools to which we are sending students. This can be done, but it will need strong leadership
                    and vision.
