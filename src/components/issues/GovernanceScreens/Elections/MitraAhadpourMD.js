                <b>1. What is your vision for education in this county?</b>
                <p>
                    Our focus should be creating the education sector of the future. It is problematic
                    to have a one-size-fits-all approach to educating hundreds of thousands of
                    students in our county in essentially the same ways. Instead, it would be far more
                    effective to embrace a deep understanding of each student’s learning strengths
                    and challenges, to result in far more effective education for students. I see many
                    exciting opportunities to implement more individualized educational programs for
                    students, which is supported by extensive research that seeks to prepare
                    students to be creative problem solvers through building greater cognitive, social
                    and emotional skills.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>2. Is there a specific issue that motivates you to serve on this board?</b>
                <p>
                    I want to serve on the board because we need fresh and innovative thinking to
                    address the complex challenges faced by our students and their families, and
                    because we need more collaboration and transparency with our larger
                    community, to seek out and listen to their ideas and concerns more broadly and
                    more inclusively. With students at the center of all our decisions, together we can
                    implement innovative initiatives to ensure our student have safe, enriching
                    schools that support them in being ready to take on the challenges their futures
                    will hold and to be successful throughout their lives.
                    The following are some of my priorities:

                        <li>
                            Transform our educational norms for all students to be successful through
                            evidence-based best practices.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            End the drug use in MCPS that is impacting students&#39; physical, mental, social,
                            and intellectual well-being.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Support local schools and innovative strategies to foster inclusion, diversity,
                    equity and civility.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Improve the engagement of students, parents and teachers in the
                    development of new policies.

                        <li>
                        Ensure safe and supportive school environments in all schools.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Provide innovative professional development opportunities for teachers, staff,
                    guidance counselors, paraprofessional educators and administrators.
                        </li>

                <b>3. What specific experiences or skills have prepared you to serve as a board member?</b>
                <p>
                    I am an MCPS parent, a results-oriented executive addressing complex health
                    policy issues daily and an accomplished primary care physician who listens
                    deeply. I will bring to the board fresh ideas, evidence-based decision making,
                    and collaborative partnerships with a wide variety of stakeholders from our
                    community. I have over twenty years’ experience building dynamic teams,
                    managing change with creativity and openness, innovating with new ideas, and
                    creating leading-edge programs that resolve long-standing problems.  Since
                    2018, I have gone to various MCPS schools to listen to the concerns of students,
                    teachers, staff, administrators and parents. I have talked about the silent
                    epidemic of substance use and mental health impacting our children and
                    solutions for it. I presented this fall and winter at Churchill High School and last
                    Spring at Bells Mill Elementary School. I spoke most recently at MCPS and
                    MCCPTA’s Mental Health Wellness Forum at Earle B. Wood Middle School.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I attended Wootton High School, received my bachelor’s degree from the
                    University of Maryland at College Park, earned my medical degree from the
                    University of Maryland, and completed my residency at George Washington
                    University Hospital. I am currently the Principal Deputy Director at the Office of
                    Translational Sciences at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. I oversee the
                    development and execution of innovative programs and our department’s budget.
                    I am also leading an inclusion, diversity and civility initiative. I was formerly the
                    Director at the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
                    Administration (SAMHSA) that oversaw substance use treatment programs and
                    training of health care providers. While at the National Institutes of Health, I led
                    the effort to bring consensus on nationwide initiatives to decrease health
                    disparities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While in private practice, I contributed to legislation that required Montgomery
                    County and Maryland to ensure smoke-free public spaces. As chair of the
                    Montgomery County Medical Society’s Community Service Programs, I created
                    and launched a successful tobacco awareness education program in middle
                    schools. I set aside one day per week to offer medical care for patients without
                    insurance.

                <p>
                    At Churchill High School, I am the parent chair of the PTSA Board’s Substance
                    Use Prevention Committee. With student, administration and staff support, we
                    have launched an active anti-vaping task force. Among other initiatives, our
                    committee hosted County Council Member Andrew Friedson, MCCPTA Alcohol
                    and Drug Abuse Advisory Council Voting Member and Opioid Intervention Task
                    Force Workgroup Member Laura Mitchell, and students, who spoke on the
                    realities and dangers of teen vaping, and how mental health affects this
                    epidemic.

                <b>4. One of the most critical roles of the Board of Education is to monitor the
                    work of the superintendent and hold him or her accountable for
                    performance. Do you believe the current board does a good job of
                    overseeing the superintendent? If not, how would you improve oversight?</b>
                <p>
                    MCPS has an enormous task. It is charged with nothing less than facilitating an
                    appropriate education on behalf of the children in our county. We are a large
                    county, one of the largest in the nation. I see room for improvement within
                    MCPS, and I know together we can do better. The board undertakes an
                    enormous and important role in guiding, overseeing and safeguarding the quality
                    and safety of our public schools. The ineffectiveness of the process the Board of
                    Education used in rolling out the current boundary study demonstrates their
                    misunderstanding of the important processes involved in managing change – in
                    obtaining critical and ongoing input from students, parents, educators and
                    members of the broader community. We need an increase in transparency,
                    accountability and communication to determine the will of our community
                    stakeholders, including from the superintendent. It did not escape my notice that
                    the BOE renewed the superintendent’s four-year contract without any input from
                    the public.

                <b>5. A significant body of research holds that diverse students are best served by a
                    diverse group of teachers. MCPS has substantial gaps between the demographics
                    of its students and its teachers in many of its schools. Do you believe that MCPS
                    needs more teacher diversity, and if you do, what measures would you
                    recommend for increasing it?</b>
                <p>
                    All students benefit from a diverse workforce. Research also shows that
                    students of color receive additional benefits from studying with teachers of color,
                    and from having administrators of color, who can become important role models
                    for them. With such teacher and administrator diversity, students of color are
                    much more likely to graduate from high school. Unfortunately, currently, there is
                    no clear set of evidence-based strategies throughout MCPS to ensure success
                    for all students, and particularly not for vulnerable populations. A few examples
                    of strategies with impact include increasing cultural competence among all staff
                    and students at schools; setting high expectations for all; providing rigorous,
                    engaging curricula of all students; and recruiting, developing and retaining
                    diverse and highly qualified teachers, staff, principals, paraeducators and
                    guidance counselors. It is not enough, however, to simply ensure diversity. We
                    also need strategies for inclusion once we have created diverse high school
                    populations at all levels. That takes foresight, planning and a careful
                    understanding of the needs and goals of various populations. I would also
                    include Special Education students as an important population of diversity we
                    need to more carefully address.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <b>6. There is much attention given to ensuring that students are career ready in
                    addition to being college ready upon graduation. Do you consider career
                    readiness to be a critical mission for MCPS? If yes, what thoughts do you have
                    about how K-12 systems can support all students to be career ready? If not, why
                    not?</b>
                <p>
                    Life readiness – including a certain amount of career readiness - should be a
                    critical mission for MCPS. Our traditional emphasis on grades and test scores is
                    no longer enough. I challenge us to think about broader outcomes, not just
                    agreeable subject test results. We know from much research that standardized
                    test scores do not adequately gauge a child’s success in life. It is valuable to
                    support and measure student engagement; development of social and emotional
                    health; critical thinking; ability to collaborate to solve real-world challenges; and
                    development of strong citizenship skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For students to be successful in life there is need for a whole student approach
                    that includes early learning, and a school climate that enables learning and well-
                    being and family engagement. We are missing safety in our school
                    environments. There are students who are vaping and using drugs in
                    classrooms, bathrooms, hallways and buses. Schools need to become equipped
                    to address what is fast becoming an epidemic of substance use, addiction and

                    mental illness. There are evidence-based practices to prevent substance use and
                    reduce anxiety and stress and improve the well-being of our children.
                </p>

                <b>7. There has been much attention within MoCo and nationwide on the disparities in
                    FARMS rates and in student demographics across schools within the same
                    district. Some argue that this is the result of housing patterns and outside the
                    purview of schools to address. Others argue that the school system must address
                    the consequences because there are educational ramifications. What are your
                    thoughts on this issue?</b>
                <p>
                    There are many factors that influence success of students in school and life.
                    There are schools in the nation who are closing the opportunity gaps through
                    equitable allocation and smart use of resources. There is need for evidence-
                    based multipronged system wide strategy that address the root causes of
                    disparities. There are so many opportunities to improve academic outcomes and
                    close the opportunity gap. One way that I believe we could more equitably
                    allocate resources among all our schools in the county is by placing highly
                    desirable, competitive magnet, language immersion, IB and academy type
                    programs within each school so that families voluntarily choose to attend one
                    school or another based on the program that will best suit their children. Once
                    students are voluntarily diversifying their populations according to programs of
                    intertest, it is incumbent on us to ensure inclusivity within those populations,
                    particularly ensuring as well that we do not create “schools within schools” and
                    ensure that the entire population connects effectively.

                <b>8. What factors do you believe should be considered in adjusting school boundaries
                    and how would you prioritize them?</b>
                <p>
                    We know that fostering inclusion, diversity, equity and civility benefits all
                    students. I think most of us would also agree that disparities in academic and
                    career outcomes based on one’s race or economic background are unfair and
                    unacceptable. We need multi-faceted policies developed in collaboration with
                    students, parents, educators and community members to address these
                    disparities. Dividing communities, as the current boundary study rollout has done,
                    has resulted in many unintended consequences, including creating divisions
                    among friends, mistrust, and much anxiety. Simply collecting and using raw
                    numbers to examine boundary lines does not begin to give us a complete picture
                    of the realities of our community and neighborhood schools. Many unfortunate
                    outcomes can result when introducing comprehensive social change of this
                    nature, such as any eventual boundary change would create - the sadness of
                    children being moved away from their friends, their lack of ability to participate in
                    after school events because of further travel requirements, and sleep deprivation
                    factors caused by traveling further from their homes to attend other schools can
                    negatively affect their health, which in turn harms their educational attainment.

                    Given the rapidly changing populations in Montgomery County, as we are gaining
                    an estimated 2,500 new students each school year, we need to understand how
                    to best use our existing facilities and think carefully about how we meet the
                    needs of new populations. Examining how we can best maximize our tax dollars
                    and use our existing school system effectively is important and must be done in
                    an open and close partnership with our community members.
