            <b>1. What is your vision for education in this county?</b>
            <p>
                My vision is for truly diverse, inclusive, equitable schools, where every student feels safe, welcome and
                valued every day. A system that embraces an evidence base for every decision in a transparent way. It is
                for a school system in which our students are held accountable to high standards, with the supports they
                need to continuously increase their knowledge, skill and ability to think critically – in that way leaving
                MCPS truly college and career ready. My vision is also for a school system in which all members of our
                school communities – students, teachers, staff, families – are viewed as valuable partners, whose wisdom
                is essential to making the best decisions possible about our schools, and in particular for intentionally
                included the student voice, and their lived experience in our schools, as a central piece of all decision-
                making. My vision is also for a school system in which there is true consistency of programs, courses,
                opportunity and excellence across all levels. I also deeply believe that MCPS must embrace Open Data as
                the way we do business – the way we engage with stakeholders and the world at large. Being honest about
                who we are as a system – what we’re doing well, what we’re not, how we’re spending our money and
                whether that spending is effective – is one way to build trust and make good decisions.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>2. Is there a specific issue that motivates you to serve on this board?</b>
            <p>
                I’m not motivated by a single issue, but am partly motivated by some candidates who seem to be. I know
                – from a decade spent learning about and advocating for our students and schools – that the array of
                issues our school system must substantively address every day is vast. The Board of Education annually
                directs the expenditure of a $2.5 billion operating budget, and a capital budget ranging from $250-$300
                million. Our county and our students need and deserve individuals serving on the Board of Education who
                have a wide and deep knowledge of our schools, and understand that the purpose of our schools is to serve
                every student well, and ensure every school is excellent, and make whatever data-driven, evidence-based
                decisions are necessary to achieve that purpose.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>3. What specific experiences or skills have prepared you to serve as a board member?</b>
            <p>
                I believe that collectively all of my areas of professional work – nursing, law, public health and teaching
                in MCPS – give me an enormous range of relevant expertise to bring to the Board of Education. Almost
                every issue and every decision before the Board can benefit greatly by being critically and objectively
                assessed through each of those lenses. Perhaps more importantly though, I know – I mean I really know
                this school system. After a decade of county-wide advocacy through my work with, and leadership roles
                in, MCCPTA I’ve worked substantively on a great many issues impacting students and schools. I’ve also
                collaborated with school communities all over the county on a wide variety of topics and priorities. As
                important, I’ve built strong relationships throughout MCPS, county government, our Delegation, and with
                non-profit partners who support our students and schools. I believe, universally, those with whom I’ve
                worked over the past decade would say that I am a thoughtful, constructive, reliable partner who truly
                believes it’s not about taking credit, it’s about getting things done.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>4. One of the most critical roles of the Board of Education is to monitor the
                work of the superintendent and hold him or her accountable for
                performance. Do you believe the current board does a good job of
                overseeing the superintendent? If not, how would you improve oversight?</b>
            <p>
                I believe the current Board needs to be more willing to ask questions, and insist that the superintendent
                and the school system transparently share with all stakeholders the data upon which they are making
                decisions. Recent instances of major system changes – the introduction of a Deputy Superintendent last
                summer and the recently announced central office reorganization – were made with no external
                consultation with stakeholders, and seemingly limited internal consultation. I truly think that was a
                mistake – especially during this time in which we have significant system-wide decisions to make to
                create a more equitable school system, but the method MCPS is using to get to that point is creating
                distrust. I do not believe that the superintendent needs to vet every decision through a process of
                community engagement, but to leave all stakeholders completely out of the loop until a major change is
                announced isn’t the best choice for a school system that needs to build trust. The Board of Education
                should play a role in seeing that decisions aren’t made so completely behind closed doors. I also believe
                the office of the Board of Education should be restructured – with a true Ombudsman, and several
                independent analysts to allow the Board of Education to do its own research and analysis, and not be
                wholly reliant on the school system. Creating that level of independence in the Board, a bit of check and
                balance on the nation’s 13 th largest school system, along with a true ombudsman to objectively address
                constituent concerns, is a way to make better decisions and increase public trust and confidence in the
                work of the Board.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>5. A significant body of research holds that diverse students are best served by a
                diverse group of teachers. MCPS has substantial gaps between the demographics
                of its students and its teachers in many of its schools. Do you believe that MCPS
                needs more teacher diversity, and if you do, what measures would you
                recommend for increasing it?</b>
            <p>
                I absolutely believe that every student should see themselves reflected in the curriculum we teach and the
                teachers and staff inside the halls and walls of their schools, and that our current cadre of teachers is not
                diverse enough to do that to scale. I think MCPS’ new teacher recruitment initiative – which started this
                year but will fully ramp up in FY21 when Dr. Statham takes it on full time – has promise. Reaching out
                directly and substantively to all colleges and universities east of the Mississippi- including all HBCUs-
                with Schools of Education, connecting with education majors in the first year, building mentoring
                relationships, providing opportunities for them to get to know MCPS, and incentives for them to come
                and teach here. An emphasis on connecting with prospective teachers of color, and partnering them with
                strong mentors – experienced, effective MCPS teachers - to work with throughout their college years. I
                think we should consider a program that is essentially a year or two ‘apprenticeship’ for those new
                teachers, partnering with their mentor so that they can teach alongside and learn from them, grow their
                skills, have strong and ongoing support, share their knowledge and innovative ideas in the classroom
                without all the solo burdens of being a first year teacher - I know how overwhelming it is to navigate
                being a new teacher in MCPS.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think too – MCPS needs to grow our own. As a system we are more than 50% black and brown. We
                should intentionally create opportunities for our students of color to explore careers in education. Work
                with great organizations like the Minority Scholars Program and Identity to encourage students to
                consider teaching as a profession, mentor them, better promote the Early College program through which
                students can obtain their AA in elementary or special education while in high school. Maintain
                connections with those young students as they move on to college – providing them ongoing support and
                opportunities to learn about and experience teaching in MCPS. Work with the County and State to
                promote scholarship programs for education majors, and loan forgiveness programs for teachers. Make
                becoming a teacher attainable and attractive to our impressive, diverse student population.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>6. There is much attention given to ensuring that students are career ready in
                addition to being college ready upon graduation. Do you consider career
                readiness to be a critical mission for MCPS? If yes, what thoughts do you have
                about how K-12 systems can support all students to be career ready? If not, why
                not?</b>
            <p>
                As a CTE teacher in MCPS, I know that all students can benefit from a Career/Technology program.
                Gaining a professional level certification in high school is a real-world benefit, and the soft skills required
                for the world of work but often lacking in the work we do in the classroom are invaluable. In my class we
                take seriously holding students accountable to the expectations of the medical workplace – reliability,
                timeliness, teamwork, communication, critical thinking. Learning and earning those things in high school
                provides not just real-world preparation to immediately enter high-demand professions, but also a great
                way for a student to become independent and financially ready for whatever comes next for them –
                including pursuing a college degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a system, MCPS can support all students in becoming career ready by providing an array of CTE
                opportunities, specifically buildings the professional ‘soft skills’ of accountability, reliability,
                interpersonal communication, and collaboration in more of our courses, ensuring all students are aware of
                CTE opportunities and have a commonsense road map that shows them how to participate in a CTE
                program and efficiently satisfy graduation credits, and continuously assessing student interest so that our
                CTE offerings are satisfying evolving demand instead of a offering a menu of CTE offerings that never
                changes.

            <b>7. There has been much attention within MoCo and nationwide on the disparities in
                FARMS rates and in student demographics across schools within the same
                district. Some argue that this is the result of housing patterns and outside the
                purview of schools to address. Others argue that the school system must address
                the consequences because there are educational ramifications. What are your
                thoughts on this issue?</b>
            <p>
                Montgomery County’s de facto segregated schools ARE the result of housing patterns – de facto
                segregated neighborhoods result in de facto segregated schools. That needs to change, and the Board of
                Education should expand its area of work to include working closely with county planning and other
                agencies to see how we can share county-wide student generation and school enrollment data to support
                better decisions about housing patterns, and ensure residential development results in truly affordable
                housing. The Board can’t direct planning decisions, but can be an influencer in county decisions that
                make it possible for residents to live and work wherever they choose, and not be limited to certain parts of
                the county because of affordability.
            </p>        
            <p>
                The school system must also address the consequences of segregation – both demographic and economic
                – because there are real consequences for all students when schools aren’t diverse and there are schools
                highly impacted by poverty. We need to work on those issues on multiple fronts. Boundaries must
                change as a first, commonsense step to easing our capacity challenges – as a system we aren’t
                overcapacity at any level (ES, MS, HS) but we have schools at 200% of capacity, schools at 62%
                capacity, 400 portables costing $6 million/year and overcrowded schools near schools with seats. Once
                commonsense adjustments are made to even out enrollment in adjacent schools, we need to look at the
                equitable and accessible placement of high quality programs throughout the system – making it possible
                for any student to attend any program in which they find value. For elementary schools, the
                implementation of universal pre-k will help more children achieve grade level benchmarks in reading and
                math by 3 rd grade. Adopting the Community School model in all elementary schools with greater than
                50% FARMs-eligible students is something we must do as well. MCPS is looking to implement that
                model in 8 elementary schools in 2020-21, using the first Concentration of Poverty grant from the
                Blueprint for Maryland’s Future legislation. Hopefully funding will be available to scale Community
                Schools to The issue of de facto segregation in our schools is an evolving one, having lots of tools to
                address those challenges is key, but so is objectively monitoring our progress and impact in an ongoing
                way and being willing to make necessary changes.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>8. What factors do you believe should be considered in adjusting school boundaries
                and how would you prioritize them?</b>
            <p>
                As above, use objective, comprehensive, countywide data as the starting point for all decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                Board of Education policy FAA specifies the four factors that must be considered when choosing a site
                for a new school, changing boundaries, and establishing geographic assignment plan (Clusters) -
                demographics, geography, stability of assignments over time, and facility utilization. Those factors make
                sense to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given our current school capacity and demographic reality, I would suggest that MCPS pick the low-
                hanging fruit first – eliminate some capacity stress with non-CIP solutions. We should identify our easiest
                opportunities to realign boundaries to take advantage of available seats adjacent to overcrowded schools –
                ease capacity stress without spending Capital dollars, and save money by reducing the need for portables
                (which would also enhance student safety) and possibly reducing maintenance costs as we have fewer
                overburdened buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, use the boundary analysis data to place unique programs and opportunities throughout the school
                system in ways that make them truly accessible to all – looking very intentionally at geography, public
                transit, and the location of similar programs. See what that does with our school capacity and
                demographics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, if we’re a data-driven school system making evidence-based decisions, we need to use the data
                and evidence base to look at the significant impacts of diversity in our schools. We’re a diverse school
                system, but not a system of diverse schools. Imbalanced demographics in a school don’t prepare students
                for the world that they live in, and into which they will launch once they leave MCPS. Research shows
                the negative impacts of concentrated poverty in schools, and the positive impacts of truly diverse student
                populations. If we’re looking at boundary shifts, and have relatively equal choices, as Policy FAA directs,
                when looking at options the Board of Education should especially strive to create a diverse student body
                in the affected schools
