            <b>1. What is your vision for education in this county?</b>
            <p>
                My vision is to ensure that all students are given multiple pathways and opportunities to fulfill their
                academic potential, by providing a thriving, dynamic, and stimulating educational environment
                with which to learn.

            <b>2. Is there a specific issue that motivates you to serve on this board?</b>
            <p>
                The inspiration for me to serve on the Board of Education is the same motivation that has inspired
                my many years of volunteerism in the MCPS system – our students. I am committed to ensuring
                that every single student, in every single school, located in every neighborhood, receives the best
                possible education that will lead them successfully beyond high school graduation.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>3. What specific experiences or skills have prepared you to serve as a board member?</b>
            <p>
                I have had the great honor and privilege to serve MCPS in a variety of volunteer positions when
                my family moved to Montgomery County just one week before the start of the Fall 2009 school
                year. For eleven years, I have volunteered and served alongside educators, administrators,
                parents, and students. Through my volunteer service, I have gained a unique perspective as to
                the support our educators, administrators, and school staff need, and have learned first-hand the
                community support our underserved students need to succeed. My commitment to the students of
                MCPS is steadfast and is reflected through my volunteer service. I am ready to put my years of
                volunteer service to serve all students in MCPS.

            <b>4. One of the most critical roles of the Board of Education is to monitor the
                work of the superintendent and hold him or her accountable for
                performance. Do you believe the current board does a good job of
                overseeing the superintendent? If not, how would you improve oversight?</b>
            <p>
                I do not believe that I have enough information to adequately and fairly assess whether the Board
                of Education has done a good job with its oversight of the Superintendent. In my view, the Board
                of Education has only fueled the fires of our collective imaginations as to what has been done
                because of its lack of transparency.
            </p>

            <b>5. A significant body of research holds that diverse students are best served by a
                diverse group of teachers. MCPS has substantial gaps between the demographics
                of its students and its teachers in many of its schools. Do you believe that MCPS
                needs more teacher diversity, and if you do, what measures would you
                recommend for increasing it?</b>
            <p>
                Yes. I believe that MCPS should increase the diversity of its teaching staff to qualified
                candidates. All students, not just minority students, benefit from a diverse teaching staff. I
                believe there are a few initiatives that have proven successful in reaching, recruiting, and
                retaining minority teachers, such as implementation of mentoring programs, recruitment
                outreach, and the provision of incentives.

            <b>6. There is much attention given to ensuring that students are career ready in
                addition to being college ready upon graduation. Do you consider career
                readiness to be a critical mission for MCPS? If yes, what thoughts do you have
                about how K-12 systems can support all students to be career ready? If not, why
                not?</b>
            <p>
                Yes. Providing students with multiple pathways to success following high school graduation is
                important. I believe the Career and Technical Education currently taught at select high schools, is
                an outstanding program. Not all students want to pursue post-secondary higher education
                immediately upon graduation. Providing students with vocational training while still in school and
                being able to receive industry certification in a career-ready job, increases their success beyond
                high school.

            <b>7. There has been much attention within MoCo and nationwide on the disparities in
                FARMS rates and in student demographics across schools within the same
                district. Some argue that this is the result of housing patterns and outside the
                purview of schools to address. Others argue that the school system must address
                the consequences because there are educational ramifications. What are your
                thoughts on this issue?</b>
            <p>
                There are many factors that contribute to a child’s educational success and ability to learn, with
                student / family poverty level as the most important predictor. More often, families within the
                same socioeconomic status reside within the same neighborhoods. I believe that in any high
                school cluster that has a Title I designated school within its boundary, the elementary schools
                should be transformed into Community schools where additional programs and services can be
                provided to all community members – such as academic support, family support, early childhood
                development, and healthcare support.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>8. What factors do you believe should be considered in adjusting school boundaries
                and how would you prioritize them?</b>
            <p>
                I believe the most important factors when considering boundary modifications are capacity,
                geography, and diversity, in that order.
