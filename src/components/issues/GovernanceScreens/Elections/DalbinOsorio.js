            <b>1. What is your vision for education in this county?</b>
            <p>
                My vision for education in Montgomery County is one built on equity and sustainable progress
                for the next generation of students. It is the one we are working towards in Montgomery County.
                My vision is for an education system that pushes the envelope forward and becomes a blueprint
                for other states to follow as opportunity gaps are closed, and all students are given the tools to
                succeed in college, career, and community.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>2. Is there a specific issue that motivates you to serve on this board?</b>
            <p>
                Closing the opportunity gap, by far. The opportunity gap has only widened since I graduated
                high school in 2003. My daughter, who is 19 months old, will start school in a couple of years
                and I refuse to not do my part to ensure she comes out of her academic experience fully prepared
                for the real world, and that the students I receive referrals for have every chance at success.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>3. What specific experiences or skills have prepared you to serve as a board member?</b>
            <p>
                I was a Math and ELA Teacher for four years, have been a foster care and preventive social
                worker with families and children, have ran three Title 1 Programs in underperforming schools,
                have worked with unaccompanied refugee minors, domestic violence victims, and have provided
                therapy to children in special-education settings. Every professional step I’ve taken has begun
                with a family asking me to teach, help, and protect their children. It is a responsibility I do not
                take lightly. I believe in transparency, honesty, creativity, and possess a desire to do the right
                thing no matter what the cost is. I am the product of a single-parent household, and I saw my
                mother struggle for most of my life, and it is something I vowed my daughter would never go
                through. Everything I’ve done has been under the belief that children win when adults give them
                the tools to do so. It is that professional experience, both in and out of the classroom, that frankly
                no one in the race has, and what makes me qualified is that I earned that experience because it
                was the right thing to do and not because I believed I’d run for Montgomery County Board of
                Education in 2020.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <b>4. One of the most critical roles of the Board of Education is to monitor the
                work of the superintendent and hold him or her accountable for
                performance. Do you believe the current board does a good job of
                overseeing the superintendent? If not, how would you improve oversight?</b>
            <p>
                I think the Board of Education and the Superintendent should function like a parent/child
                relationship, and I’d compare the current relationship to really supportive cousins. We have to
                hold the Superintendent accountable and not just be a rubber stamp to his ideas, and we have to
                be willing to challenge him when we believe he is wrong, while also working with the
                Superintendent on our shared goals. I do not think every member of the current Board does that,
                and I’d improve that oversight by publicly and privately pushing back. I’m a fighter, I always
                have been, because my end goal is to make sure that education is a worthwhile investment for the
                children and families of Montgomery County.

            <b>5. A significant body of research holds that diverse students are best served by a
                diverse group of teachers. MCPS has substantial gaps between the demographics
                of its students and its teachers in many of its schools. Do you believe that MCPS
                needs more teacher diversity, and if you do, what measures would you
                recommend for increasing it?</b>
            <p>
                MCPS absolutely needs more diversity, both in teachers and in dedicated support staff, because
                all the research shows that students of color are more likely to graduate if they have diverse
                teachers. I would utilize a number of strategies: from Grow Your Own initiatives where you’re
                creating a funnel from MCPS graduates who go on to earn their Teacher certification and then
                are hired to teach in MCPS; to developing and funding teacher residencies; to creating
                partnerships between MCPS and state universities that will subsidize and improve training for
                teachers to teach in high-need schools and in high-demand subject areas; to creating and
                fostering partnerships with local teacher preparation programs, including those at minority-
                serving institutions; to coordinate student teaching placements and vet candidates for hire before
                they graduate; to assigning teachers of color a veteran mentor in their first year to assist with the
                transition from academia to the classroom; to taking advantage of Title II’s optional 3%
                leadership set-aside funds that can enable states to strengthen the quality of school leaders by
                investing in principal recruitment, preparation, induction, and development focused on
                supportive school leadership. All of these strategies build on each other, brick by brick, because
                if we develop teachers of color into school leaders of color, then we will absolutely see a change
                in the opportunity gap and in teacher recruitment and retention.

            <b>6. There is much attention given to ensuring that students are career ready in
                addition to being college ready upon graduation. Do you consider career
                readiness to be a critical mission for MCPS? If yes, what thoughts do you have
                about how K-12 systems can support all students to be career ready? If not, why
                not?</b>
            <p>
                It should be part of the mission for MCPS, and we need to do a better job of building
                partnerships between MCPS and local businesses to expose our students to different career paths.
                Not every student is going to go to college, and that has to be okay as policy makers. Education
                is not a one size fits all, every student is unique, and there are students who will choose to not go
                to college. K-12 systems have to do a better job of preparing students for whatever success looks
                like for them: I worked at a school where our students were able to earn barbering, cosmetology,
                carpentry, and automotive certificates that they could then turn into careers upon graduating high
                school. This was in addition to their core courses. I’ve helped students pass dual-language GED
                Programs where they earned trade certifications. Its that kind of expertise I’d bring to the school
                board role, as we push MCPS into the 21 st Century with what we are offering our students.

            <b>7. There has been much attention within MoCo and nationwide on the disparities in
                FARMS rates and in student demographics across schools within the same
                district. Some argue that this is the result of housing patterns and outside the
                purview of schools to address. Others argue that the school system must address
                the consequences because there are educational ramifications. What are your
                thoughts on this issue?</b>
            <p>
                I believe that a school system works well when it is part of the community it is serving, and not a
                separate entity. What happens in the community impacts what happens in schools and what
                happens in schools impacts what happens at home, and any community that thrives recognizes
                this. We often say that it takes a village to raise children, but what are we doing to create those
                healthy villages? When I was a foster care social worker, I saw firsthand how instability at home
                led to difficulties in the classroom. When I was a teacher, I saw how those difficulties manifested
                themselves in academic and behavioral struggles. As a therapist, I was able to see how clinically
                detrimental the lack of connectivity between school, home, and community was. I was a FARMS
                kid myself, and the low socioeconomic community I was a part of impacted my self-esteem,
                social and emotional development, and had I not connected with school staff that was invested in
                me personally? Then my trajectory would’ve been different. It is absolutely essential that we pay
                that same level of care and investment to our Montgomery County youth.

            <b>8. What factors do you believe should be considered in adjusting school boundaries
                and how would you prioritize them?</b>
            <p>
                The boundary analysis and, what I believe will be recommended, subsequent boundary changes
                comes down to a resource issue. Are we allocating the resources in our schools in an equitable
                fashion? If we are not, then what do we do to rectify that? The biggest factors to me are what
                would enrollment at every school look like (we have a school overcrowding issue in our
                schools), what will the travel time be for students and parents (in the event of an emergency),
                and what will the staffing ratios be with the new numbers. We do not make policy anecdotally,
                but we can use those very real stories to craft the policy we create. There are students in
                Montgomery County who describe terrible physical school conditions, while others have shared
                that they are in overcrowded classrooms with new teachers who leave within a year or so. We
                have school leaders who do not have the resources to implement the services they’d like to
                implement. My biggest priority is closing the opportunity gap and helping to create a more
                equitable education system for all children, regardless of their zip code, and any decision I make
                or policy I create or support will be undertaken with that as my first priority.
