        Over the last several months, my wife, Mikel, and I have met with Montgomery County residents
        and community leaders to explore avenues to continue serving our community. Through these
        conversations, we’ve gained an even deeper understanding of the challenges facing our
        county—challenges including overcrowded schools and lack of resources for school construction,
        an affordable housing shortage, and ineffective business retention and expansion plans resulting
        in a sluggish job market. We recognize that sharing information—access to information—is our
        greatest ally in finding solutions to those challenges. So today, with great excitement, we
        announce the launch of our newly formed public outreach and think-tank organization, Council
        for Advocacy and Policy Solutions (CAPS).
        </p>

        <p>
        CAPS is a nonprofit organization that will bridge community and politics, by providing
        information and education on the impact of current and upcoming local and state-wide
        legislation. We will conduct studies on best practices across the county and offer solutions to
        local challenges. As an information resource and a hub for innovative and attainable solutions,
        we aim to empower residents to join the conversation and to be a part of the solution.
        </p>

        <p>
        Additionally, CAPS will work beyond the boundaries of a customary policy institute, by
        developing pilot programs to effect real-change solutions to the challenges impacting our
        communities. We will seek partnerships with community members, experts, corporate and
        nonprofit organizations, and local governments, to implement successful and sustainable pilot
        programs. Today, in partnership with Maryland institutions for higher education and local
        chambers of commerce, we are pleased to announce the first CAPS pilot, <a href="https://capsmd.org/news/business-incubator">our Seed-Stage
        Incubator Program.</a>

        We invite you to peruse our website and join us in our mission to educate and activate our
        community. Our organization is in its infancy and we are committed to growing: growing our
        knowledge, growing our content, growing our contributors, growing our community—and to this
        end, we welcome your support! We hope you will join us on social media, as well as our website,
        to stay up-to-date on our important work.
        </p>

        When we share information and ideas, and we all have a seat at the table, we close gaps,
        effectuate positive change and elevate our communities. Thank you for your continued support.
