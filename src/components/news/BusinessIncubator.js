        <h1>David Blair Announces Business Incubator and Student Entrepreneur Cultivation Program</h1>

        <p>Rockville, MD, Release: May 14, 2019. <i>For Immediate Release</i></p>
        <p>
            Lifelong Montgomery County resident and businessman, David Blair, announced today that he is launching 
            a seed-stage incubator program for undergraduate and graduate students in the Maryland University system, 
            reaching the end of their academic careers. CAPS Ed will provide a physical space where early-stage 
            companies are surrounded by the right combination of mentors and funding. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Blair will offer space in the Tower Oaks building in Rockville to house the incubator. 
            CAPS Ed is in conversation with several Maryland higher education institutions and has 
            partnered with the Greater Bethesda Chamber of Commerce. The chamber has offered to discount 
            membership fees to selected student start-ups. Hands-on support in the form of business and 
            product strategy, growth and metrics, and investor pitches will exist on site, 
            as well as a place to network with other early-stage companies affiliated with the incubator. 
            The first class of entrepreneurs is expected this year.   
        </p>

        <p>
            ‘We have bright students, and brilliant faculty within Maryland’s business schools, and that’s something worth 
            investing in and cultivating,’ Blair said. ‘We’ll provide space for these early-stage businesses, 
            connect students with established business leaders within the community to provide networking and mentorship, 
            and facilitate introductions to angel investors.’
        </p>

        <p>
            The group expects recruiting and retaining Maryland educated students will pay-off big for the 
            state’s academic institutions and economy, especially relating to job growth opportunities.
