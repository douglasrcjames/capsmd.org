        <p>For Immediate Release: May 16, 2019</p>
        <p>
          Rockville, MD – Council for Advocacy and Policy Solutions (CAPS) in partnership with David Blair,
          announced today a seed-stage incubator program for undergraduate and graduate students in
          Maryland institutions for higher education, reaching the end of their academic careers. CAPS will
          provide a physical space where early-stage companies are surrounded by the right combination of
          mentors and funding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Blair, a lifelong Montgomery County resident and businessman, will offer space in the Tower Oaks
          building in Rockville to house the incubator. CAPS is in conversation with several Maryland higher
          education institutions and will partner with the Greater Bethesda Chamber of Commerce, enabling
          student start-ups to get involved in and make connections with the local business community. Hands-on
          support in the form of business and product strategy, growth and metrics, and investor pitches will exist
          on site, as well as a place to network with other early-stage companies affiliated with the incubator. The
          first class of entrepreneurs is expected this year.  
        </p>

        <p>
          “We have bright students, and brilliant faculty within Maryland’s business schools, and that’s something
          worth investing in and cultivating,” Blair said. “We’ll provide space for these early-stage businesses,
          connect students with established business leaders within the community to provide networking and
          mentorship, and facilitate introductions to angel investors.”
        </p>

        <p>
          CAPS expects recruiting and retaining Maryland educated students will pay-off big for the state’s
          academic institutions and economy, especially relating to job growth opportunities.
