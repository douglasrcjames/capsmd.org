        <p>For Immediate Release: May 16, 2019</p>
        <p>
          Rockville, MD – Council for Advocacy and Policy Solutions (CAPS) announced today, the launch of a new
          study focusing on best practices for recruiting and retaining teachers of color in counties across
          Maryland. In October of 2018, MCPS released hiring data for the 2019 fiscal year, indicating “Of all
          13,698 MCPS teachers: 72.76 percent are White; 12.35 percent are Black/African American; 7.08
          percent are Hispanic; 6.02 percent are Asian and less than 2 percent are American Indian, Pacific
          Islander, or of two or more races.”
        </p>

        <p>
          By comparison, according to the MCPS Annual 2017-18 report, of all MCPS students: 28.3 percent are
          White; 21.4 percent are Black/African American; 32.3 percent are Hispanic; 14.4 percent are Asian and
          less than 5 percent are American Indian, Pacific Islander, or of two or more races. 
        </p>

        <p>
          While MCPS has seen an 11.5 percent increase in teaching diversity in recent years because of programs
          such as The BOND Project, CAPS will further explore best practices around the state of Maryland and
          across the United States, particularly reflecting on the effectiveness of financial incentives as a means to
          support recruitment and retention efforts.

        Last year, Prince George’s County offered $3,000 signing bonuses to fill their vacant 800 teaching positions. 
        The bonuses were “offered to bi-lingual teachers and those who are willing to commit to teaching in some underperforming schools,” 
        according to WUSA.

          Montgomery County educates one of the highest groups of English for Speakers of Other Languages
          (ESOL) learners in Maryland, and as our diverse student population continues to grow, the need for
          varied representation in teaching and administrative positions across the county, becomes even more
          vital to student development and success. Accordingly, CAPS will spend the next few months exploring
          best practices, and looks to release data sometime at the end of Q3.
